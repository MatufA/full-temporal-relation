NYT20000113.0267,rendered,turned,ei1,ei2,BEFORE,AFTER,ei1-ei2,Good for Attorney General Janet Reno for the sensible opinion she rendered in the case of Elian Gonzalez. Some semblance of constitutional order was necessary after a Miami judge turned legal logic on its head in an effort to route to her family court his Florida relatives' appeal to keep the 6-year-old in the United States.
NYT20000113.0267,returned,ruled,ei5,ei7,BEFORE,AFTER,ei5-ei7,"Immigration, after all, is strictly a federal matter. If the Immigration and Naturalization Service order that Elian must be returned to his father in Cuba is to be contested , Reno ruled correctly that the only proper venue is federal court, not state or local."

His presence on American soil is necessary to dispel doubts about his fitness as a father _ raised maliciously by Elian's Miami relatives _ and to end speculation that he is indifferent about reclaiming custody of his son. With Gonzalez all but out of sight in Cuba, the relatives have had a free hand to distort the case with bogus legal arguments and unsubstantiated claims that Elian is afraid to see his father."

In hopes of trumping the law, they have unreasonably demanded that a panel of child psychologists determine Elian's fate. The best outcome would be for the relatives to turn Elian over to his father as soon as Gonzalez arrives , and to do so in a spirit of kinship that makes the transition as smooth as possible for Elian.
