Task Overview:
You are given a text, in which some verbs are uniquely marked by ei[NUMBER] (e.g., ei[1], ei[2]).
Your task is to say which of the verbs happened first in a chronological order.
More specifically, you need to return for each pair of verbs, which is two sentence apart,
 a single label out of the four potential labels:
BEFORE - the first verb happened before the second.
AFTER - the first verb happened after the second.
EQUAL - both verbs happened together.
VAGUE - It is impossible to know based on the context provided.

write "DONE!" at the end of your answer

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _

Suspected bombs ei1:EXPLODED outside the U.S. embassies in the Kenyan and Tanzanian capitals Friday, ei2:KILLING dozens of people, witnesses ei3:SAID.

The American ambassador to Kenya was among hundreds ei12:INJURED, a local TV ei4:SAID.

the correct labels are:
- ei1:EXPLODED BEFORE ei2:KILLING (since EXPLODED happened before KILLING)
- ei1:EXPLODED BEFORE ei3:SAID (EXPLODED happened before SAID)
- ei2:KILLING BEFORE ei3:SAID (KILLING happened before SAID)
- ei1:EXPLODED BEFORE ei12:INJURED  (since EXPLODED happened before INJURED)
- ei1:EXPLODED BEFORE ei4:SAID  (since EXPLODED happened before SAID)
- ei2:KILLING BEFORE ei12:INJURED  (since KILLING happened before INJURED)
- ei2:KILLING BEFORE ei4:SAID (KILLING happened before SAID)
- ei3:SAID AFTER ei12:INJURED (SAID happened before INJURED)
- ei3:SAID BEFORE ei4:SAID (since witnesses SAID happened before a local TV SAID)
- ei12:INJURED BEFORE ei4:SAID (INJURED happened before SAID)
- ei12:INJURED BEFORE ei5:SAID (INJURED happened before SAID)
- ei4:SAID VAGUE ei5:SAID (a local TV SAID happened before a U.S. Embassy official in Nairobi SAID)
- ei5:SAID VAGUE ei8:SEE (SAID happened before SEE)
- ei5:SAID AFTER ei9:WENT (since SAID happened before WENT)
- ei5:SAID BEFORE ei10:SAID (since a U.S. Embassy official in Nairobi SAID happened before SAID)
- ei8:SEE AFTER ei9:WENT (SEE happened before WENT)
- ei8:SEE BEFORE ei10:SAID (since SEE happened before SAID)
- ei9:WENT BEFORE ei10:SAID (WENT happened before SAID)

Provide ONLY the final answer.

Output Format:
For each pair of verbs, provide the temporal relation as and explain shortly in one line:
- ei1:[VERB1] BEFORE ei2:[VERB2] (since [VERB1] happened before [VERB2])
- ei1:[VERB1] AFTER ei2:[VERB2] (since [VERB1] happened after [VERB2])
- ei1:[VERB1] VAGUE ei2:[VERB2] (since [VERB1] could happen before and after [VERB2] based on the context provided)
if ei1 BEFORE ei2 and ei2 BEFORE ei3 don't write ei1 BEFORE ei3.

replace the [RELATION] with the right label and add explanation:

{relations}
