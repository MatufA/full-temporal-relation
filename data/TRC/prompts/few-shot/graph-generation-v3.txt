Task Overview:
You are given a text, in which some verbs are uniquely marked by e[NUMBER] (e.g., e[1], e[2]).
Your task is to say which of the verbs happened first in a chronological order.
More specifically, you need to return for each pair of verbs, which is two sentence apart,
 a single label out of the four potential labels:
BEFORE - the first verb happened before the second.
AFTER - the first verb happened after the second.
EQUAL - both verbs happened together.
VAGUE - It is impossible to know based on the context provided.

the correct labels are:
- e1:EXPLODED BEFORE e2:KILLING (since EXPLODED happened before KILLING)
- e1:EXPLODED BEFORE e3:SAID (EXPLODED happened before SAID)
- e2:KILLING BEFORE e3:SAID (KILLING happened before SAID)
- e1:EXPLODED BEFORE e12:INJURED  (since EXPLODED happened before INJURED)
- e1:EXPLODED BEFORE e4:SAID  (since EXPLODED happened before SAID)
- e2:KILLING BEFORE e12:INJURED  (since KILLING happened before INJURED)
- e2:KILLING BEFORE e4:SAID (KILLING happened before SAID)
- e3:SAID AFTER e12:INJURED (SAID happened before INJURED)
- e3:SAID BEFORE e4:SAID (since witnesses SAID happened before a local TV SAID)
- e12:INJURED BEFORE e4:SAID (INJURED happened before SAID)
- e12:INJURED BEFORE e5:SAID (INJURED happened before SAID)
- e4:SAID VAGUE e5:SAID (a local TV SAID happened before a U.S. Embassy official in Nairobi SAID)
- e5:SAID VAGUE e8:SEE (SAID happened before SEE)
- e5:SAID AFTER e9:WENT (since SAID happened before WENT)
- e5:SAID BEFORE e10:SAID (since a U.S. Embassy official in Nairobi SAID happened before SAID)
- e8:SEE AFTER e9:WENT (SEE happened before WENT)
- e8:SEE BEFORE e10:SAID (since SEE happened before SAID)
- e9:WENT BEFORE e10:SAID (WENT happened before SAID)

Provide ONLY the final answer.

Output Format:
For each pair of verbs, provide the temporal relation as and explain shortly in one line:
- e1:[VERB1] BEFORE e2:[VERB2] (since [VERB1] happened before [VERB2])
- e1:[VERB1] AFTER e2:[VERB2] (since [VERB1] happened after [VERB2])
- e1:[VERB1] VAGUE e2:[VERB2] (since [VERB1] could happen before and after [VERB2] based on the context provided)
if e1 BEFORE e2 and e2 BEFORE e3 don't write e1 BEFORE e3.

replace the [RELATION] with the right label and add explanation:

{relations}
