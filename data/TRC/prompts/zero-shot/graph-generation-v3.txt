Task Overview:
You are given a text, in which some verbs are uniquely marked by ei[NUMBER] (e.g., ei[1], ei[2]).
Your task is to say which of the verbs happened first in a chronological order.
More specifically, you need to return for each pair of verbs a single label out of the four potential labels:
BEFORE - the first verb happened before the second.
AFTER - the first verb happened after the second.
EQUAL - both verbs happened together.
VAGUE - It is impossible to know based on the context provided.

Output Format:
For each pair of verbs, provide the temporal relation as and explain shortly in one line:
- ei1:[VERB1] BEFORE ei2:[VERB2] (since [VERB1] happened before [VERB2])
- ei1:[VERB1] AFTER ei2:[VERB2] (since [VERB1] happened after [VERB2])
- ei1:[VERB1] VAGUE ei2:[VERB2] (since [VERB1] could happen before and after [VERB2] based on the context provided)
if ei1 BEFORE e2 and ei2 BEFORE ei3 don't write ei1 BEFORE ei3.

replace the [RELATION] with the right label and add explanation:

{relations}
