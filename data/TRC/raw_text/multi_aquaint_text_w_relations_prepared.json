Kopp, a 44-year-old anti-abortion protester, ei10:lived last year, the official ei11:said.\nThe first DNA tests did not ei12:exclude a match between the two strands.\nKopp has ei13:eluded authorities since they ei14:obtained a warrant for him as a material witness in the Oct. 23 sniper ei15:shooting of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a 52-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist who ei16:performed abortions. The ei17:search for Kopp was recently ei18:extended to Mexico.\nMeantime, FBI agents and Metropolitan Police officers ei19:assigned to a joint terrorism task force here ei20:scanned the crowd of anti-abortion protesters at the annual ei21:March for Life on Capitol Hill, because Kopp has been either a ei24:participant in or ei23:arrested at this ei25:march in each of the last three years, according to another law enforcement official,\nBoth officials ei26:requested ei27:anonymity.\nThe FBI is ei28:conducting further DNA tests of the hair ei29:found outside Dr. Slepian's home.

NATO warplanes ei45:helped ei46:end the ei85:war in Bosnia almost four years ago and now are ei47:poised to ei48:intervene in Yugoslavia should peace ei49:efforts in the province of Kosovo ei50:fail.\nA decade ago, the military planning of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic was ei51:built around the possibility of a ground assault toward the west. As NATO allies, the goal ei52:is much smaller armies ei53:capable of meeting a variety of contingencies.\nThe State Department ei54:says the three new members ``ei55:enhance NATO's ability to fulfill its core mission of collective defense, ei56:respond to a range of security challenges and ei57:reduce the possibility of another major conflict in Europe of the kind that has ei58:claimed so many American lives.''\nNATO Secretary General Javier Solana ei59:says, ``The ei60:accession of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland ... is perhaps the clearest ei61:demonstration of the fact that Europe is ei62:growing closer together.''\n``ei63:Extending membership to these three democracies ei64:helps to ei65:stabilize a region that historically has been the staging ground for many of the ei66:disasters of this century.''\nBut many Russians -- and some Americans -- ei67:are wary about the eastward encroachment of NATO. Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ei68:says the push east ei69:signifies a ei70:rejection of the common European security system that was ei71:discussed at the ei72:end of the Cold War.\nRussian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov ei73:calls ei74:extending NATO membership into Eastern Europe ``a ei75:movement in the wrong direction.''\n``All European states must ei76:cooperate in creating a joint security system,'' he was ei77:quoted as ei78:saying. ``All European states must ei79:work together in the interests of all countries rather than of separate groups.''",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) --\nThe FBI ei1:put alleged terrorist mastermind Osama Bin Laden and anti-abortion activist and ei2:accused doctor killer James Charles Kopp on the bureau's list of the Ten Most Wanted fugitives Monday.\nFBI Director Louis Freeh ei3:said the U.S. government is ei4:offering a reward of up to $5 million for information that ei5:leads to the ei6:arrest and ei7:conviction of Bin Laden, ei8:indicted as the architect of the twin ei9:bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The Aug. 7, 1998, ei10:bombings ei11:killed more than 200 people, including 12 Americans. It ei12:is the largest reward the government has ever ei13:offered for a fugitive.\nA total of $650,000, meanwhile, is being ei14:offered for information ei15:leading to the ei16:arrest of Kopp, who is ei17:charged with ei18:gunning down Dr. Barnett Slepian last fall in his home in Buffalo, N.Y. Slepian ei19:provided legal ei20:abortions in western New York state.\nThe standard $50,000 reward for information ei21:leading to a listed fugitive's ei22:capture ei23:comes on top of a $500,000 reward ei24:announced earlier by Attorney General Janet Reno, plus a $100,000 award ei25:offered previously by the FBI.\nReno ei26:said Bin Laden and Kopp ei27:have one thing in common: Each wrongly ei28:believes he is ei29:justified in ei30:using all means possible to ei31:achieve his goal.\nThey also ei32:have in common locations ei33:unknown to the authorities.\nFreeh ei34:said Bin Laden may be ei35:hiding out in Afghanistan, which has ei36:been uncooperative in the ei37:case. Kopp, meanwhile, may have ei38:approached the border with Mexico, but it is ei39:unknown whether he ei40:crossed into that country, ei41:said Freeh.\nKopp ei42:purports to ei43:be a devout Roman Catholic, and the majority of jobs he has ei44:held over the past 20 years have ei47:been related to the anti-abortion movement, the Justice Department ei46:said in a news release.\nState Department international security director Dave Carpenter ei48:said that ei49:placing Bin Laden on the most-wanted list ``ei50:underscores the unwavering ei51:commitment'' by the United States ``to ei52:fight terrorism.'' The FBI ei53:continues to ei54:receive threats from individuals and organizations with ties to Bin Laden, Freeh ei55:said.\nCarpenter ei56:said the U.S. government's counterterrorism program has ei57:paid out over $6 million in some 20 cases around the world for credible information.\nOn the FBI list, Bin Laden and Kopp ei58:replace two former Libyan intelligence agents ei59:charged in the Dec. 21, 1988, ei60:bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that ei97:killed 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland. The two were ei61:removed from the list after Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi ei62:agreed in April to ei63:hand them over for trial in the Netherlands, a neutral venue. Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi are ei64:charged with murder, conspiracy to ei65:commit murder and ei66:violations of international aviation safety laws.\nBin Laden and Kopp ei67:are the 455th and 456th persons to be ei68:placed on the FBI's most wanted list, which ei69:began in 1950.

But Albright and other U.S. officials have strongly ei28:disputed that notion, ei29:saying the priority had been ei30:rescuing all possible, African and American.\nOn Friday, when Albright ei31:set aside ei77:vacation plans for the hastily planned ei79:trip to East Africa, the State Department ei33:lifted a warning against travel to Kenya, whose economy relies heavily on foreign visitors, to further ei35:ease any strain in the aftermath of the ei84:tragedy.\nJust ahead of Albright's one-day ei85:trip, the State Department on Sunday ei36:issued an updated ``worldwide caution'' to U.S. travelers in the aftermath of the Aug. 7 ei88:bombings at American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and because of fresh ei89:threats to U.S. interests abroad.\nAn accompanying statement specifically ei39:warned ``against all travel to Pakistan.'' The State Department also ei40:ordered the ei92:departure of all non-emergency personnel and families of employees from the embassy at Islamabad and from U.S. consulates in Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar.\nThe warnings ei41:came after Pakistan ei42:handed over to Kenyan officials a suspect in the U.S. Embassy ei95:bombings, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, also known as Mohammad Sadiq Howaida and Abdull Bast Awadh.\nThe first batch of evidence from the Nairobi ei96:bombing ei44:arrived over the weekend at the FBI lab at the bureau's Washington headquarters and is being ei45:analyzed, FBI officials ei46:said Monday.\nMany more shipments are ei47:expected, but the first batch ei48:contained cotton swabs ei49:taken at the ei99:blast site in hopes of ei50:picking up microscopic residues that could positively ei51:identify what the bomb was made of. A U.S. official ei53:said last week that field tests ei54:suggested the presence of a Czech-made plastic explosive called Semtex that has been ei57:used by terrorist groups before.",

    "text": "MIAMI (AP) --\nIn efforts to ei1:prevent Elian Gonzalez's ei110:return to Cuba, an anti-Castro lawmaker ei164:subpoenaed him Friday to ei165:testify before a congressional committee and one of his Miami relatives ei2:sought to ei3:become his legal guardian.\nRep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., ei4:said he ei166:subpoenaed 6-year-old Elian to ei167:testify before the Committee on Government Reform on Feb. 10, so he remains in the country while the courts ei6:consider his case.\nAbout 100 supporters ei7:cheered wildly as Elian -- ei8:holding the subpoena in front of his face while being ei9:held aloft by a relative -- ei10:appeared outside the house where he has been staying with relatives. He ei12:gave the peace sign before ei13:heading back indoors.\nBut in Cuba, Elian's father was angry about Burton's subpoena.\n``What right does that man have?'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez ei14:said during a news ei114:conference in his hometown of Cardenas. ``I am the father of Elian and immigration has ei15:said that I am the only one who can ei16:speak for him\n``Why should it be ei17:delayed? Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''\nElian was ei18:found Thanksgiving Day ei116:clinging to an inner tube at sea after his mother, stepfather and eight other people ei168:drowned while ei19:trying to ei20:reach Florida by boat.\nThe boy was ei21:placed with his great-uncle and great-aunt in Miami, but the Immigration and Naturalization Service ei22:ruled Wednesday that he must be ei23:returned to his father in Cuba by Jan. 14. The ei118:decision ei24:touched off ei119:protests in the Cuban-American community.\nBurton, the committee's chairman, ei25:said in a release he ``ei26:issued a subpoena to Elian Gonzalez to ei27:ensure that no precipitous action is ei28:taken until the Florida State court in Miami can adequately ei29:address the Gonzalez case.''\nBurton is an outspoken critic of the Castro regime. A 1996 law ei30:named for him and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., ei31:strengthened the 1959 trade ei124:embargo against Cuba.\nCommittee sources who ei32:spoke on the condition of anonymity ei33:said that while the subpoena ei34:requires that Elian ei35:attend the ei125:hearing in Washington, it's highly unlikely that his actual appearance will be ei36:sought.\n``The Congress of the United States is ei169:affording Elian Gonzalez what INS and this administration has not, which is his legal right and his right to due process,'' ei37:said Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation. ``This ei38:gives him the protection that he will not be ei39:repatriated to Cuba between now and Feb. 10.''\nEarlier Friday, lawyers ei40:filed a petition on behalf of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. It is an ei132:attempt by his Miami relatives to ei41:get guardianship and then to ei42:file for applications for admission to the United States and asylum, ei43:said David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of Miami.\nNeither the lawyers nor Elian's relatives would ei44:comment before the judge's ei137:ruling, which is ei45:expected early next week.\nIn Cuba, meanwhile, tens of thousands of people ei46:rallied in a seaside plaza Friday night to ei47:demand his ei138:return. ``Elian, Cardenas awaits you ... with kisses,'' a Cuban country music band ei48:sang.\nAlso Friday, Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, ei49:accompanied by one of the family's lawyers, ei50:flew to Washington to ei51:appeal directly to Attorney General Janet Reno. Gov. Jeb Bush also ei52:asked President Clinton to ei53:reverse the INS order.\nReno ei54:said she is ei55:considering the issues ei56:raised in the ei141:meeting and the state court action.\n``I plan to ei58:respond as quickly as possible,'' she ei59:said in a statement.\nReno has ei60:said she was ei61:consulted on the INS ei145:decision and ei62:approved of it. Clinton ei63:said Friday the INS did the right thing.\n``I ei64:believe they ei65:followed the law,'' Clinton ei66:said. ``This is a volatile and difficult case. ... We ei67:need to ei68:keep this out of the political process as much as possible.''\nIn contrast to Thursday, when two Cuban exile leaders and 133 other people were ei69:arrested and police were ei70:forced to ei71:use tear gas to ei73:disperse a crowd, protesters in Miami were much calmer Friday.\nHowever, the Cuban exile community ei74:called for more civil disobedience. About 100 protesters ei75:marched in front of the federal building in Orlando on Friday night, ei76:waving Cuban and American flags and ei77:chanting ``Cuba libre'' and ``long live the USA.''\nTwo men ei79:carried a banner that ei80:said ``President Clinton, Please ei81:keep Elian in the United States.''\nProtesters planned a large ei151:demonstration in Little Havana on Saturday and were planning to ei83:drive around Miami International Airport on Monday.\n``If the child is ei84:sent back to Cuba without his day in court, all hell is going to ei86:break loose,'' ei87:said Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an anti-Castro group.\nThe ei154:rally in Cardenas, Cuba, was ei88:marked by songs, tears and personal recollections of Elian. It was the most personal and emotional of many held since early December, when Cuban President Fidel Castro ei90:promised mass ei158:mobilization until the boy was ei91:returned to his father.\nElian's father, his four grandparents and his great-grandmother ei92:began ei93:weeping as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage as the group ei96:sang of the boy's mother. Gonzalez ei97:looked particularly distraught, his eyes red from ei98:crying.\nDuring the day Friday, Elian ei99:played in his relatives' yard with a puppy named Dolphin, a gift from Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. The black Labrador ei101:chased Elian around the yard and playfully ei170:nipped at his blue soccer shorts.\n``Elian ei102:tells me he does not ei103:want to ei104:go back to Cuba,'' ei105:said Delfin Gonzalez, another of Elian's great-uncles. He ei106:said Elian ei107:wants his family to ei108:come here.",

    "text": "HAVANA (AP) --\nThe grandmother of Elian Gonzalez ei1:said she is willing to ei2:go to Miami to ei3:bring the six-year-old boy home to Cuba, while Fidel Castro's point man on U.S. relations ei4:expressed impatience at Washington's ei80:failure to ei5:enforce a ei81:repatriation order.\nIn a massive ei83:demonstration ei6:demanding Elian's ei84:return, tens of thousands of Cuban women -- hundreds visibly pregnant and others ei7:carrying small children -- ei8:marched along Havana's seaside boulevard on Friday to the U.S. mission, ei9:waving Cuban flags and ei10:chanting ``ei125:Bring back our son!''\nElian's young stepmother, Nelsy, flanked by his two grandmothers, was at the head of the ``ei126:March of the Combatant Mothers,'' ei11:pushing his half-brother in a stroller. Cuban authorities ei12:estimated that 100,000 women ei13:participated in the ei127:march.\nThe ei86:protest ei14:marked a return to the larger ei88:demonstrations of early December, when hundreds of thousands of people ei15:rallied in some of Cuba's biggest gatherings since the ei90:triumph of the ei91:revolution that ei16:brought President Castro to power 41 years ago.\nElian, the boy at the center of the international ei92:dispute, was ei17:found ei18:clinging to an inner tube Nov. 25 off the coast of Florida after his mother, stepfather and others ei128:died in a ei19:failed ei94:attempt to ei20:reach U.S. shores. He has been staying with relatives in Miami who do not ei23:want to ei24:send him back to Cuba.\nThe U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service had ei25:ruled that Elian must be ei26:returned to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and ei27:set Friday as the deadline for his ei96:repatriation to Cuba.\nBut this week, Attorney General Janet Reno ei28:lifted the deadline to ei29:give Elian's relatives in Miami a chance to ei30:fight in federal court to ei31:keep the boy with them.\nRicardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly and Castro's point man on U.S.-Cuban relations, ei32:told The Associated Press that Cuban authorities are frustrated by Reno's ei98:failure to ei34:set a new deadline and the INS's ei99:failure to ei35:enforce its decision.\n``No ei101:enforcement ei102:action was ever ei36:announced by the INS,'' he ei37:said.\nAlarcon, former Cuban ambassador to the United Nations, ei38:dismissed suggestions by some U.S. politicians and Elian's relatives in Miami that Elian's father ei104:travel from Cardenas, Cuba, to Miami to ei39:pick up the boy. He ei40:said Cuba has not ei41:prohibited Gonzalez from ei42:going to Miami to ei43:retrieve Elian, American attorneys -- and even American officials -- have ei129:counseled against it.\n``We have ei130:gotten the same message from U.S. officials -- in private -- several times that it is not advisable for this man to ei44:appear in U.S. territory,'' ei45:said Alarcon.\nThe concern in Cuba always has been that if Gonzalez ei46:goes he will immediately ei47:become ei48:involved in political and legal problems that will ei49:prevent his speedy ei107:return.\nElian's paternal grandmother, Mariela, ei50:told reporters that she was willing to ei51:go to Miami to ei52:retrieve her grandson if it was ei53:assured to her that she could ei54:pick him up and ei108:return immediately to Cuba without ei55:become ei56:embroiled in legal or political problems.\n``I would ei57:go there just for one minute to ei58:get him. To ei59:get him. Nothing more,'' she ei60:said.\nSince his sea ei109:rescue, Elian has been increasingly ei61:referred to in Cuba as ``our son,'' a boy hero symbolizing the government's decades-long ideological ei111:battle with Cuban exiles in Miami. Rather than a ei113:clash between two governments, the ei114:dispute over Elian is a ei115:battle between Cubans of differing political views living on both sides of the Florida Straits.\nReno ei65:allowed the ei116:extension of the deadline after ei66:rejecting a Florida state court order that Elian remain in Miami until March 6 to ei68:hear ei119:arguments by his American relatives. Reno ei69:said the state court had no jurisdiction in the case, but that the Miami relatives should be able to ei70:make their case in federal court.\nElian's paternal great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, is ei71:fighting to ei72:keep the boy with him in Miami, ei73:saying he can ei74:give the child a better life outside Cuba. He and others who ei75:oppose the boy's ei122:return to Cuba ei76:say that Elian's mother died to ei77:give the boy freedom in the United States.",

Liberty!'' ei23:blocked intersections and ei24:cut off access to the Port of Miami. In one case, riot police had to ei25:use tear gas to ei27:clear them.\nSaying ``nothing is certain'' about Elian's ei88:return, Cuba's government ei28:exhorted citizens to ei29:keep ei30:rallying, after the boy's relatives in Miami ei31:said they would ei32:look for ways to ei33:get around Wednesday's ei89:ruling by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to ei34:repatriate the child by Jan. 14.\nCuban exiles in Miami will now ``ei104:proceed with all their resources to ei105:impede or ei35:delay'' the ei91:ruling, Cuba ei36:predicted Wednesday.\n``We cannot ei37:stop ei38:mobilizing! The struggle must not ei39:stop for one minute!'' ei40:said a message that was ei41:read Wednesday night to several thousand ei42:rallying Cuban scientists.\nei107:Rescued on Nov. 25 by fishermen off the Florida coast, Elian has ei43:become the subject of an international custody ei97:battle.\nHis mother ei106:died in a boating ei98:accident ei45:trying to ei46:get Elian and herself to the United States. The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, lives in Cuba and ei47:wants Elian back.\nBut Elian's relatives in Miami have ei48:fought to ei49:keep the boy, ei50:saying they could ei51:provide him with a better life. Since the INS ei100:decision was ei52:announced Wednesday, they have ei53:said they will ei54:appeal the ei101:decision.\nGonzalez has not ei55:appeared publicly since the ei102:announcement. Neither he nor Elian's four grandparents could be ei56:located in their hometown of Cardenas, east of Havana.",

    "text": "HAVANA (AP) --\nCalling the mother of Elian Gonzalez ``an excellent girl,'' President Fidel Castro ei1:said Friday she had been ``practically ei2:kidnapped'' by the boyfriend who ei125:perished along with her on the boat ei3:wreck her 6-year-old son ei4:survived.\nCastro's remarks to a ei77:conference of economists were ei5:aimed at those who ei6:say that Elian should remain in the United States because his mother ei126:sacrificed his life to ei8:take her to ``freedom,'' a vision he ei9:called a cliche.\nHe ei10:placed the blame on Lazaro Rafael Munero, who apparently ei11:organized the ill-fated ei80:journey on which Elian's mother Elisabeth Brotons and 10 other people -- including Munero -- ei127:died.\nCastro ei14:called Munero -- who reportedly ei15:drove a taxi and ei16:engaged in unofficial businesses in the Cuban city of Cardenas -- a ``ruffian'' on whom Cuban police had ei128:amassed ''100 pages of reports.''\nAccording to sources ei17:quoted by the Miami Herald, Munero had ei18:fled to Florida in June 1998 and ei19:returned to Cuba later that year, only to be ei129:jailed for several months.\n``The mother was practically ei20:kidnapped along with the boy'' to ei21:make the late-November ei83:trip, Castro ei22:said.\nThe Cuban leader ei23:said Elian had been especially ei24:loved by his parents because the mother had earlier ei25:suffered seven ei84:miscarriages.\nEarlier Friday, Cuba's communist government ei26:celebrated the ei85:birth of independence hero Jose Marti on Friday with ei88:rallies ei27:calling for the ei89:return of Elian Gonzalez, the ``boy martyr'' at the center of an international custody ei91:battle.\nTens of thousands of children ei28:flooded Havana's Plaza of the Revolution to ei29:deliver a dual homage to Marti and Elian, the 6-year-old Cuban whose ei93:rescue off Florida's coast two months ago ei30:set off a tug-of-war between relatives living on both sides of the Florida Straits.\nWearing their red Communist Pioneer neckerchiefs, a string of young boys and girls ei32:recited poems they ei33:wrote for Elian, dubbed Cuba's ``boy hero'' and ``symbolic child,'' and for Marti, commonly known on the island as Cuba's ``teacher'' and ``apostle.''\nThe Communist Party daily Granma ei35:compared Elian with revolutionary icon Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara and ei36:said the boy ``has been ei130:converted forever into a symbol of the crimes and injustices that imperialism is capable of ei37:committing against an innocent.''\nThe commemorations were similar to those ei38:held here annually for Marti, the revolutionary and poet who ei39:fought for Cuba's independence from Spain in 1898. But this year, children ei40:wore T-shirts ei103:bearing Elian's portrait with their school uniforms.\nThe commemorations ei41:began early Friday morning, as tens of thousands of Cubans ei42:marched through Havana's streets by torchlight. Similar ei104:events were ei43:held all day in the capital and across the island.\nIn Old Havana, hundreds of children ei44:marched around the Parque Central ei105:chanting ``We will ei45:save Elian!'' A small group of girls ei46:wore construction paper handcuffs -- an apparent reference to the government's characterization of Elian's retention in the United States as a ``ei110:kidnapping.''\nFidel Castro's government has been ei47:using such traditional political ei111:events -- along with other ei112:rallies almost every day -- to ei48:draw attention to the case of Elian, who was ei49:rescued Nov. 25 while ei50:clinging to an inner tube. His mother and 10 others ei131:died at sea while ei51:trying to ei52:reach the United States.\nFor the past two months, Elian's father has ei53:demanded that the boy be ei54:returned to him in Cuba, and the U.S. government has ei55:said that father and son should be ei132:reunited.\nBut Elian's paternal great-uncle in the United States, ei56:backed by the anti-Castro Cuban American National Foundation, is ei57:fighting in the courts to ei58:keep the boy in Miami.\nCuba ei59:kept up its ei114:condemnation of the ei115:handling of Wednesday's ei116:meeting between Elian and his grandmothers at the home of a Roman Catholic nun in Miami Beach, Fla. Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin ei60:said after the ei117:meeting she ei61:thought Elian should stay in the United States.\n``First Fruits of the Monstrousness,'' ei63:read the full-page editorial on the front of Friday's edition of the Communist Party daily Granma. It ei64:offered more details and criticisms of the perceived treatment that Elian's grandmothers, Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez, ei65:received from O'Laughlin, the Miami relatives and other anti-Castro Cubans during the ei120:encounter.\nIn an ei121:interview with the Spanish language broadcast of CNN, Elian's father also ei66:criticized how the ei123:meeting was ei67:handled. He ei68:repeated charges that his relatives and others in Miami had ei69:offered him money to ei70:stay in the United States with his son.\n``They are not ei71:going to ei72:buy me,'' ei73:said Juan Miguel Gonzalez. ``What is important for me is that they ei74:return the boy to me as soon as possible.''",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) --\nThe Justice Department is ei1:reviewing whether alcohol-related driving ei97:violations or other ei98:actions by Elian Gonzalez' relatives in Miami warrant ei4:moving the 6-year-old boy to a different, temporary custodian.\n``That matter is under review,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder ei5:said when ei6:asked Thursday about the ei100:violations. ``We will ei7:look at that, ei8:try to ei9:make some kind of factual determination and then ei149:decide what steps, if any, ei11:need to be ei12:taken.''\nIn addition, the department is still ei13:considering a ei103:request last week from Elian's father in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to have Elian's temporary custody ei14:shifted from his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to another great-uncle, Manolo Gonzalez. Both great-uncles live in Miami.\nJuan Miguel Gonzalez ei16:objected to the media access to Elian that Lazaro Gonzalez's family has ei17:permitted and to the treatment of Elian by psychologists ei18:selected by Lazaro Gonzalez's family.\nMeantime, the possibility of a ei107:meeting between Attorney General Janet Reno and Lazaro Gonzalez's family ei19:reemerged Thursday. Reno ei20:agreed to a ei108:meeting earlier this week, only to have Lazaro Gonzalez's family ei21:withdraw the request. But ei110:discussions have been ei22:renewed, a Justice official ei23:said Thursday.\nLater Thursday, two of Elian's Miami cousins ei24:sought support on Capitol Hill for legislation that would ei25:help ei26:keep the boy in America. One of them, Marisleysis Gonzalez, ei27:told a news ei113:conference that reports of alcohol-related ei115:violations by relatives should not have bearing on the custody case.\n``We're ei29:doing what's in Elian's best interest. My family is a very close family,'' she ei30:said.\nAnother cousin, Georgina Cid, ei31:said Elian's father had ei32:intended to ei33:flee Cuba himself, but was being ei150:coerced by the Castro government to ei34:stay and ei35:make certain statements.\n``He ei36:wanted to reunite with his son -- but not in Cuba,'' Cid ei37:said. She ei38:said she and other family members had ei39:spoken to Elian's father by phone both before and after the mother ei151:perished.\nThe father's response when ei40:learning that his boy was safe in Miami was ``ei120:take ei121:care of him until I can ei41:go, ei42:meaning ei122:go to the United States,'' Cid ei43:said.\nA group of Florida lawmakers ei152:introduced legislation this month to ei44:grant Elian American citizenship, which would ei45:take the ei154:decision about Elian's future away from INS and ei46:give it to a Florida family court. Support for the bill has been ei47:waning.\nReno has already ei48:met with Lazaro Gonzalez's lawyer and a Catholic nun from Miami who ei49:oppose his ei125:return to Cuba, as well as with Elian's two grandmothers from Cuba, who ei50:want him ei51:returned.\nIn Havana, Elian's father ei52:joined President Fidel Castro on Thursday in a ei53:packed auditorium in what has ei54:become a daily public ei126:rally to ei55:press for the boy's ei127:return. Speaker after speaker ei56:denounced the United States and ei153:extolled the virtues of Cuba's communist ei128:revolution.\nA Justice official, who ei57:requested anonymity, ei58:said the department has authority, if necessary, to ei59:shift temporary custody to someone other than Lazaro Gonzalez. The boy was ei60:placed in his care after being ei61:found ei62:clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic last Thanksgiving ei63:following a boat ei132:wreck that ei64:killed his mother and 10 other people.\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service has ei65:ruled in favor of the father's ei134:request that the boy be ei66:returned to him in Cuba, but that ei135:decision was ei67:put on hold while the Miami relatives ei68:battle in federal court to ei69:keep him in this country.\nHolder ei70:said that INS ei71:acted appropriately but ``now that we have this new information, we'll have to ei72:look at it, and ei73:see, like I ei74:said, what steps if any are appropriate.''\nFlorida state records ei76:show Lazaro Gonzalez, 49, was ei77:found guilty of ei78:driving under the influence of alcohol at least twice from 1991 to 1997. Records also ei79:show Lazaro Gonzalez's 62-year-old brother, Delfin Gonzalez, has been ei80:found guilty at least twice of ei81:driving under the influence.\nOn Wednesday, Ricardo Alarcon, head of Cuba's National Assembly and Castro's key man for U.S.-Cuban relations, ei82:said the ei141:convictions ei83:prove the homes of those uncles are no place for Elian.\n``Practically everyone surrounding him either has been, or may be in the future, ei84:joining the prison system in the U.S. That's not the best interest of the child,'' Alarcon ei85:told reporters in Havana. He ei86:said Elian was ``surrounded by two drunks.''\nArmando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, ei87:dismissed the ei143:criticism: ``Elian is surrounded by love.'' Elian's relatives and other Miami supporters ei88:say his mother died to ei89:give him freedom.\nThe newspaper of Cuba's Communist Party, daily Gramma, ei90:published a letter Thursday from Elian's grandmothers to Reno and Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner ei91:asking for Elian's ei146:return.\n``No material good ei92:exists that can ei93:compete with the value of the family, and it is humiliating for us that people are still ei94:questioning our love and the future that awaits Elian at his home,'' ei95:said a Spanish version of the letter, ei96:dated Feb. 4.",

    "text": "HAVANA (AP) --\nIn an apparent bid to ei1:show flexibility in the ei90:campaign to ei2:return Elian Gonzalez to Cuba, President Fidel Castro ei3:said the boy's father has ei4:offered to ei5:travel alone today to the United States to ei6:pick up his 6-year-old son.\nHowever, a group ei91:trip with the boy's relatives and classmates ei7:appeared more likely than a solo ei93:trip by his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.\nGonzalez, the boy's stepmother, his baby half-brother, a dozen classmates and some adults ei8:planned to ei124:apply for American visas today at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, the American mission here. The group would be ready to ei9:leave for the United States as soon as Tuesday, Castro ei10:said.\nGonzalez ei11:said he would ei12:go ei13:get his son alone if U.S. authorities ei14:promised they would ei15:turn Elian over to him immediately and ei16:allow them to ei17:fly back to Cuba right away, Castro ei18:said Sunday.\n''I am willing to ei19:leave tomorrow, absolutely alone and ei20:transport myself to where the child is,'' Castro ei21:read from a letter ei22:signed by Gonzalez.\n''Only the government of the United States can decide if it ei23:prefers this variant,'' ei24:continued the letter, which Castro ei25:read on a state television station ei97:broadcast.\nGonzalez for months ei26:refused ei98:requests by Elian's Miami relatives to ei27:go to the United States to ei28:claim the boy.\nAt the same time, the lawyers for the boy's relatives in Miami ei29:said they might ei30:try to ei31:argue that his father is an unfit parent.\nThe White House has ei32:said there is no evidence of unfitness, and the father's lawyer, Gregory Craig, ei33:said the ''outrageous'' allegations were a sign the Miami relatives were ei34:getting desperate.\nIt was unclear if American authorities would ei35:give the Cubans the 28 visas they have ei36:proposed. The group would not ei37:leave until Gonzalez had assurances that American authorities would ei38:give him custody of his son.\nThe plan is for him and other members of the delegation to ei39:stay in Washington at the homes of Cuban diplomats while awaiting the results of a federal court ei105:appeal by Elian's Miami relatives, who have temporary custody of him and are ei40:seeking to ei41:block his ei107:return to Cuba.\nIn another dramatic ei108:move, Castro ei42:announced that the chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington was willing to ei43:revoke the diplomatic immunity on his residence, where Cuba has ei44:proposed Gonzalez ei45:stay with Elian and the rest of his family during the federal ei111:appeal -- which could ei46:take as long as a month or two.\nCastro ei47:said that if those who ei48:oppose ei49:returning Elian to Cuba are worried about ei50:turning the child over to ''what is ei51:considered Cuban territory, then our Interests Section is willing to ei52:renounce diplomatic immunity of the residence of the chief of this section in Washington.''\nElian has been at the center of an international tug-of-war since he was ei53:rescued off the coast of Florida in late November. His mother was among 11 people who ei125:died after they boat ei54:sank during the ei55:attempted ei56:crossing from Cuba to the United States.\nElian's Miami relatives are ei57:fighting to ei58:keep the boy in the United States, ei59:saying they can ei60:give him a better life off the communist island. Gonzalez has ei61:demanded his rights as the child's sole surviving parent and ei63:wants Elian ei64:returned to him.\nIn its latest deadline, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ei65:given the Miami relatives until 9 a.m. Tuesday to ei66:sign a paper promising to ei67:turn over the boy to immigration authorities if they ei68:lose their federal court ei119:appeal.\nThe Miami relatives thus far have ei69:refused to ei70:sign the document, and in recent days ei71:said they would not ei72:turn Elian over to his father if he ei73:came to the United States. Earlier, they had ei74:said they would ei75:give the boy to Gonzalez if he ei76:made the ei120:trip.\nBefore his Sunday night address, Castro ei77:played the affectionate grandfather to the 12 first-graders ei78:proposed to ei79:go on the ei121:trip, ei80:assuring them that their planned ei122:trip to Washington to ei82:retrieve their little friend was a very important ei123:mission.\nPatting some of the kids on the head, Castro ei83:assured them that they ei84:formed a powerful ''commando.''\n''Not even the Pentagon can ei85:handle these kids,'' he ei86:joked. ''We are ei87:hoping that they ei88:get their visas.''",

    "text": "MIAMI (AP) --\nAfter a weekend of bitter accusations ei1:lobbed by both sides of the Elian Gonzalez custody ei97:battle, attention ei2:returned today to the federal judges ei141:deciding a key point in the international case.\nThe 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has been ei3:asked by the U.S. government to ei4:suspend a ei99:ruling by one of its judges that ei5:prevents the ei100:removal of Elian from the country.\nSuch a ei101:decision would ei6:allow the U.S. government to ei7:push for the 6-year-old boy's swift ei102:reunion in Washington with his ei103:waiting father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who ei8:wants to ei9:return to Cuba. He has ei10:said he will ei11:wait out appeals by the Miami relatives ei12:seeking an asylum ei105:hearing for Elian before the same court -- but only if he has custody of his son.\nThere was ei13:growing apprehension outside the Little Havana home where the boy has ei14:lived with his great-uncle for nearly five months.\n''The feeling is the Clinton administration might ei15:send federal agents to ei16:pull him out of here,'' ei17:said Sergio Navarro, a 39-year-old Miami businessman who ei18:spent part of Sunday night with ei19:chanting protesters.\nElian's relatives have ei20:cared for him since November, when he was ei21:found ei22:clinging to an inner tube in the Florida Straits. His mother and 10 other people ei23:fleeing Cuba ei142:drowned when their boat ei24:sank.\nThe Clinton administration has ei25:pushed for the boy's ei112:return to his father, ei113:ruling only he can ei26:speak for his son on immigration matters. The boy's Miami relatives ei27:say he will have a better life here and have ei28:attempted to portray Juan Miguel Gonzalez as a pawn of Fidel Castro.\nThe Justice Department ei29:wants the appeals court to ei30:suspend the temporary injunction ei31:issued Thursday and also ei118:order Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, to ei32:release the boy. The relatives ei33:want the court to ei34:let them ei35:meet with Elian's father without being ei36:required to ei37:surrender the boy.\nThe court watch ei38:comes after one of the most bitter charges yet in the custody ei122:battle.\nJuan Miguel Gonzalez ei39:lashed out at his Miami relatives Sunday night, ei40:accusing them of ''child abuse'' for ei41:turning his son against him. He ei42:said they have ei43:manipulated his son to ei44:believe that his mother still may ei45:show up someday -- in this country.\n''This is child abuse and mistreatment, what they're ei46:doing to this boy,'' Gonzalez ei47:said on CBS's ''60 Minutes.'' ''The way they're ei48:abusing him, ei49:turning him against his father ... he's ei50:suffering more here amongst them than he ei51:suffered in the sea.''\nGonzalez ei52:said he didn't believe a much-publicized video taped at the relatives' home in which his son ei55:said he didn't ei56:want to ei57:go. He has ei58:spoken with Elian at least three times since he ei59:arrived in the United States on April 6, and he ei60:insisted his son ei61:wants to ei62:return to Cuba.\n''He's ei63:told me so,'' Gonzalez ei64:said. The Miami relatives are ``ei65:putting a bunch of toys in front of a 6-year-old. He cannot ei143:decide for himself. The one that ei144:decides for him is me, his father.''\nElian's Miami relatives have ei66:filed affidavits ei67:alleging Gonzalez ei145:abused his former wife and his 6-year-old son, a charge Gonzalez ei68:denied. During the time of the ei128:broadcast on Sunday, family members and Elian were outside the home of Lazaro Gonzalez and did not publicly ei69:comment after the ei129:show.\nProtesters, however, ei70:dismissed Juan Miguel's comments as either selfish or the words of Fidel Castro.\n''Fidel Castro is ei71:claiming the son, not him,'' ei72:said Olga Coto, 56, of Miami. ''He's being ei73:manipulated totally by Fidel Castro. He's not ei74:telling the truth.''\nMany ei75:worried their efforts to ei76:keep the boy in Miami would ei77:fail today, the 39th ei132:anniversary of the Bay of Pigs ei133:fiasco, an aborted ei134:invasion of Cuba by CIA-trained exiles that ei79:left much bitterness among the Cuban-American community.\n''We were ei146:betrayed by the government, by (President) Kennedy, and if they ei80:turned the child back over, it will be a second ei136:betrayal,'' ei81:said Josefa Gonzalez, who ei82:left Cuba in 1962 when she was 4.\nEarlier Sunday, protesters ei83:prayed for divine help as Easter week ei84:began, ei85:waving palm fronds and posters of the Cuban boy and Jesus.

    "text": "WASHINGTON _\nThe ei83:bombings at the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania have ei1:frightened away travelers from East Africa just as Kenya was hoping for an end to a years-old slump in foreign tourism, and as Tanzania was finally ei3:beginning to ei137:reap the benefits from a major investment in the travel industry.\nTour operators who specialize in travel in Kenya and Tanzania, which boast some of Africa's best game parks and sunniest beaches, ei6:say there have been no mass ei91:cancellations as a result of the Aug. 7 Embassy ei92:bombings in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which ei7:left more than 250 people dead.\nBut they ei8:report a number of worried ei138:calls from prospective travelers, many of them alarmed by the possibility of more terrorist ei93:attacks in the region. ``People have been ei12:calling, and we've been ei139:reassuring them that we don't ei14:see further problems,'' ei15:said Mary Mkimbo, a spokeswoman in New York for the Kenya Tourist Office.\nThe State Department, which does not ei16:want to ei17:see Kenya and Tanzania punished economically as a result of terrorist ei94:attacks that were clearly ei19:targeted at the United States, has ei20:lifted dire travel warnings ei21:issued just the ei97:bombings that ei22:urged Americans to stay away from the two countries. New public announcements ei24:put out on Aug. 13 suggest only that Americans ``exercise caution'' when ei26:visiting Kenya and Tanzania.\nEmbassy employees in both cities have ei27:gone back to ei28:work, although in new locations. The bombed-out Embassy in Nairobi is ei30:expected to be ei31:demolished after the FBI has ei32:finished ei33:gathering evidence. The embassy in Dar es Salaam ei34:suffered less damage from the ei102:blast, although it, too, may have to be ei35:razed. For now, the State Department ei36:says, Embassy employees can ei37:offer only emergency consular service.\nForeign visitors to Nairobi and Dar es Salaam since the ei104:bombings have noted a reassuringly heavy presence of both police and soldiers on the streets of the two capitals. Crew-cut FBI agents fill many of the luxury hotels in the two cities.\nWestern diplomats and intelligence officials ei40:say there is no reason to ei41:believe that terrorists affiliated with Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire who is ei44:accused of ei45:organizing the Embassy ei108:bombings, plan to ei46:strike again soon in either country.\nStill, the televised images of the charred hulks of the American Embassy buildings will likely haunt the travel industry in East Africa for years. ``The tourism industry is very sensitive to the news media,'' ei47:said Ms. Mkimbo. ``We do ei49:expect a little downward movement in the industry.''\nThe tourism industry in Kenya has been troubled for years _ in part because of the ei114:opening of new safari destinations in South Africa, in part because of Nairobi's well-deserved reputation for street crime. Tourism industry revenues reportedly ei50:dropped to $300 million last year, down from $450 million the year before.\nThe government has ei51:responded to the slump with a series of ei118:actions to ei141:lure tourists back, including a marked improvement in the service of Kenya Airways, the national airline, which has ei54:gone into partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The ei120:bombing will doubtless ei55:set back those efforts.\nTourism has never been so well-developed an industry in neighboring Tanzania, which is home to Mt. Kilimanjaro, the magnificent wildlife of Serengeti National Park and the exotic island of Zanzibar.\nBut the lack of infrastructure has ei57:worked to Tanzania's advantage in recent years given the dramatic growth in the number of adventure travelers who are willing, even eager to ei59:go without the five-star safari resorts that Kenya offers. The number of visitors to Tanzania ei61:jumped from fewer than 100,000 in 1980 to more than 300,000 last year, prompting the government to ei63:improve roads needed for safari tours.\n``Tanzania has just been underdeveloped for years, and they're ei64:beginning to ei65:develop it now,'' ei66:said Jalal Ebrahim, president of Safaricentre International, a tour operator in Manhattan Beach, Calif. ``There were fewer people in the parks in Tanzania, and that's what attracted visitors. It was more pristine.''\nEbrahim, whose company has been ei67:sending American travelers on East African safaris for 13 years, ei68:said that his company had ei69:received only one ei131:cancellation as a result of the embassy ei132:bombings _ and that he did not ei70:expect many more.\n``We had one ei133:cancellation from a couple who decided they were just going to ei72:wait and ei73:see what happened,'' he ei75:said. ``Our clients are adventure travelers and most of them are very savvy. They ei76:read a lot, they stay on top of world events.'' They ei78:understand, he ei79:said, that increasingly terrorism knows no borders.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Nairobi is now operating out of the offices of the Agency for International Development on The Crescent, in the neighborhood of Nairobi known as the Parklands; (254-2) 751-613. The Embassy in Dar es Salaam is at 285 Toure Drive; (255-51) 666-015.",

    "text": "The New York Times ei1:said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26:\nThe ei2:murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian is the latest depraved ei3:assault on the small number of courageous physicians who still ei4:risk their safety to ei5:perform legal abortions in this country. Slepian ei6:was one of only three doctors who ei7:performed abortions in the Buffalo, N.Y., area, and harassment and threats against him by anti-abortion groups had ei8:become routine over the past decade. He ei9:persevered through courage and a belief in the right of his patients to ei10:choose whether to ei11:bear a child.\nBut a principled ei12:commitment to ei13:provide a constitutionally protected ei14:service could not ei15:stop the assassin's bullet that ei16:tore through his kitchen window and into his back Friday night. His death ei17:shows again how tentative the right to abortion has ei18:become in the face of ei19:terrorism by anti-choice fanatics.\nTheir repeated ei20:acts of terrorism must be ei21:met with the severest possible ei22:crackdown by law-enforcement authorities. If an armed police officer has to be ei23:stationed outside every abortion provider's home and office, 24 hours a day, let it be ei24:done. This is an ei25:assault not only on individual doctors but on the rights and liberties of all Americans.\nLast week the FBI ei26:joined Canadian authorities to ei27:investigate a series of unsolved sniper ei28:shootings of doctors in Canada and western New York dating to 1994. In January, a week after the 25th ei29:anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision, a clinic ei31:bombing in Birmingham, Ala., ei32:killed a security guard and severely ei33:wounded a nurse.\nSince 1993, three doctors, including Slepian, three clinic employees and a clinic escort have been ei34:murdered. There have ei35:been more than a dozen attempted ei36:murders of abortion providers in the last five years. ei37:Arson and ei38:bombings at clinics have ei39:become so common that many no longer ei40:make the national news.\nIt ei41:is bad enough that conservatives in Congress and in state legislatures are ei42:working to ei43:dismantle reproductive rights by ei44:banning certain ei45:procedures, such as so-called partial birth abortion, and by ei46:requiring waiting ei47:periods and parental ei48:consent before an abortion can be ei49:obtained. But those restrictions are at least ei50:imposed by the normal give and take of political and judicial ei51:struggle in a democracy.\nWhat ei52:is outrageous is the ei53:attempt to ei54:shut down abortions by illegal means _ by ei55:shooting the doctors or ei56:bombing the clinics or ei57:harassing the women ei58:seeking to ei59:exercise their constitutional right. Some anti-abortion groups, to their credit, have ei60:denounced the ei61:bombings and ei62:shootings, but others ei63:seem reluctant to ei64:issue the strong ei65:condemnations that are ei66:warranted.\nIndeed, one particularly virulent anti-abortion Web site ei67:lists the names of doctors it ei68:says ei69:perform abortions, or ``crimes against humanity,'' with a code ei70:indicating whether they are ``ei71:working,'' ``ei72:wounded'' or a ``ei73:fatality.'' Such incendiary ei74:rhetoric, and frequent ei75:accusations by some anti-abortionists that abortion providers are ei76:committing murder, can only ei77:fuel more terrorism.\nThe ei78:increase of anti-choice laws and ongoing ei79:campaigns of harassment by protest groups, even short of murder, have ei80:worked to ei81:make abortions harder to ei82:obtain. More than 80 percent of counties in this country ei83:have no abortion provider. In 45 states, the number of doctors who ei84:performed abortions ei85:declined between 1982 and 1992.\nSlepian ei86:was among those who ei87:took a stand against ei88:restricting reproductive freedom and ei89:paid with his life. Unless these brave doctors are better ei90:protected, fewer doctors in the next generation will be ei91:willing to ei92:place themselves and their families in such danger. That is what the terrorists ei93:want. They must not be ei94:allowed to ei95:succeed.",

    "text": "Additional details of the ei1:slaying ei2:emerged on Sunday. Slepian's lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray, ei4:said the sniper's bullet ei5:entered through a partially draped kitchen window, ei6:hit Slepian in the back and ei7:exited through his chest. The doctor's wife and one of his sons ei8:were in the kitchen when the shooting ei9:occurred, Murray ei10:said.\nThe bullet ei11:bounced off a cabinet and ei12:ricocheted into the living room, where the doctor's three other children were ei13:watching television, Murray ei14:said. Slepian's wife and one son ei15:tried to ei16:revive him. Just over an hour later, he was ei17:declared dead at nearby Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital.\nFor the most part, people on both sides of the abortion issue ei18:expressed outrage at the ei19:shooting. But one abortion opponent, the Rev. Donald Spitz, the founder of Pro-Life Virginia, ei20:described Slepian's killer as a ``hero'' for ei21:ending the physician's ``bloodthirsty ei22:practice.''\n``We as Christians ei23:have a responsibility to ei24:protect the innocent from being ei25:murdered,'' Spitz ei26:said in a statement ei27:released to The Associated Press, ``the same way we would ei28:want someone to ei29:protect us. Whoever ei30:shot the shot ei31:protected the children.''\nMost other opponents of abortion, however, ei32:condemned the ei33:shooting and abortion.\nIn his Sunday Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York, Cardinal John O'Connor ei34:called the murder wrong but he ei35:urged those angered by the ei37:slaying to ei38:be equally angered by abortions. ``He ei41:called on many of the same people to ei42:express outrage at partial birth abortion, which he ei43:called the equivalent of infanticide,'' Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, ei44:said of the cardinal's sermon.\nReligious leaders in Buffalo also ei45:condemned the ei46:shooting. Bishop Henry Mansell of the Archdiocese of Buffalo ei47:said it ei48:was ``an act of madness,'' but he went on to ei50:defend the Church's opposition to abortion as ``respecting of human life in all its forms, especially the most vulnerable.''\nSusan Dudley, deputy director of the National Abortion Federation, ei51:assailed the remarks and ei52:called on anti-abortion groups to ei53:shift their tactics. She ei54:said the rhetoric of the anti-abortion movement has ei55:helped ei56:lead to violent ei57:attacks against abortion providers.\n``I ei58:think that when pro-life organizations ei59:try to ei60:distinguish between themselves and these incidents they are at best ei62:being disingenuous,'' she ei63:said. ``They are the ones who ei65:call these doctors murderers.''\nIn Amherst, residents who ei66:said they ei67:opposed abortion ei68:decried the ei69:attack and ei70:said they ei71:hoped the perpetrator was ei72:caught.\nMen ei73:smoking cigars and ei74:drinking beer with friends after ei75:shooting skeet at the Buffalo Shooting Club in Amherst ei76:said their feelings about abortion ei78:were mixed, but they uniformly ei79:denounced the ei80:killing of Slepian.\nMany residents ei81:said abortion had gradually ei82:dwindled as a local issue since Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group, ei83:started a series of largely unsuccessful ``Spring of Life'' ei84:demonstrations in 1992 ei85:intended to ei86:shut down abortion clinics and ei87:harass local doctors, including Slepian.\nLittle of the vitriol that the issue ei88:aroused in the late 1980s and early 1990s ei89:remains, residents ei90:said, and many of the local religious leaders who ei91:led the 1992 ei92:protests have ei93:moved.\n``The only people that are ei94:left ei95:are the hard-core, fanatical people,'' ei96:said Larry Finkelstien, a high school teacher who ei97:works as an escort at abortion clinics. ``Everyone else has ei98:gone away.''",

    "text": "The ei1:killing of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a gynecologist in Buffalo who ei2:performed abortions, has ei3:become a factor in at least two campaigns in New York, ei4:say political consultants and some campaign advisers.\nIn the ei5:race for attorney general, the Democratic candidate, Eliot Spitzer, who ei6:favors abortion rights, has ei7:moved quickly to ei8:make the anti-abortion position of his opponent, Attorney General Dennis Vacco, a central issue in the campaign.\nAnd in the tight ei9:race for U.S. Senate, while the Democrat, Charles Schumer, another abortion-rights supporter, has not ei10:raised Slepian's death himself, his aides ei11:say it ei12:puts a new emphasis on the issue.\nSlepian was ei13:shot in the back on Friday night as he ei14:stood in his kitchen. No suspects have been ei15:identified. Even before the ei16:killing, Schumer was ei17:tyring to ei18:draw more attention to the anti-abortion record of his opponent, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican who is also ei19:running on the Right to Life Party line.\nIn a New York Times/CBS News poll ei20:completed on Saturday, 69 percent of those polled ei21:said they did not ei22:know D'Amato's position on abortion, and only 19 percent ei23:knew that he ei24:opposed abortion rights.\nNow events are ei25:doing the ei26:work for Schumer. Slepian's death ei27:was among the first topics ei28:raised in Saturday night's ei29:debate between the two men, and it was instantly ei30:followed by a question to D'Amato on whether he ei31:opposed first-trimester abortions for adult women.\nOn Tuesday, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League ei32:plans to ei33:hold a news ei34:conference to ei35:screen a television advertisement _ ei36:made last week, before Slepian ei37:died _ featuring Emily Lyons, a nurse who was badly ei38:wounded earlier this year in the ei39:bombing of an abortion clinic in Alabama.\nThe advertisement, ei40:said Kelli Conlin, the executive director of the New York State affiliate of Naral, is ei41:intended to ei42:spotlight D'Amato's vote against the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances ei43:Act, which Schumer ei44:sponsored. The measure ei45:made it a Federal crime to ei46:attack or ei47:blockade an abortion clinic. Now, Ms. Conlin ei48:said, it will ei49:have new resonance, and the organization is ei50:considering ei51:buying more air time.\n``It's incredibly sincere and powerful and it would have ei52:been regardless,'' she ei53:said. ``But sensitivities ei54:are so heightened from the ei55:shooting in western New York that it's even more powerful.''\nDavid Eichenbaum, a Democratic political consultant who is not ei56:working for anyone in this year's campaign, ei57:said abortion ``ei58:is no longer the driving issue it once ei59:was, at least on the pro-choice side.''\nBut, Eichenbaum ei60:said: ``Sometimes an ei61:incident like this will do more to ei62:energize those who are pro-choice who otherwise might not ei63:consider that as an important an issue to ei64:go to the polls over. It ei65:brings it home.''\nD'Amato's aides would not ei66:comment about the political ramifications of the ei67:slaying, and Schumer's aides would not ei68:talk about whether they ei69:planned to ei70:refer to it in any advertisements, or whether the candidate ei71:planned to ei72:use it on the campaign trail.\n``Both Senator D'Amato and Chuck Schumer ei73:agree this ei74:was a horrific crime and a horrible tragedy,'' ei75:said Josh Isay, Schumer's campaign manager.\nBut, Isay ei76:added, ``it ei77:heightens the abortion issue.''\nSteven Goldstein, the campaign spokesman for Spitzer, ei78:was less reticent. ``Eliot is ei79:going to ei80:make a huge priority of this,'' Goldstein ei81:said. ``ei82:Stopping clinic ei83:violence is ei84:going to ei85:be a major theme of our campaign from now to Election Day.''\nIn Sunday's ei86:debate against Vacco, Spitzer ei87:attacked him for ei88:failing to ei89:enforce a court ei90:order in 1992 against anti-abortion protesters who had ei91:blocked the entrance to a clinic. It ei92:was the same clinic where Slepian ei93:worked.\nA federal judge ei94:removed Vacco, then the U.S. attorney for western New York, from the case. He was ei95:replaced with two special prosecutors. Spitzer also ei96:criticized Vacco for ei97:dismantling the Office of Reproductive Rights, which ei98:investigated threats and crimes against abortion clinics, when he ei99:became attorney general.\nOn Monday, Spitzer ei100:called for Vacco to ei101:revive that unit immediately, ei102:vowing that he would ei103:do so on his first day in office if ei104:elected.\nGoldstein, who ei105:said it ei106:was ``thoroughly, thoroughly possible'' that the issue would ei107:surface in Spitzer's advertisements, ei108:defended the use of the issue by ei109:noting that the attorney general ei110:has direct impact on the issue of clinic access.\nVacco's campaign manager, Matt Behrmann, ei111:said in a statement that Spitzer had ``ei113:sunk to a new and despicable low by ei114:attempting to ei115:capitalize on the ei117:murder of a physician in order to ei116:garner votes.''\n``It's possible that New York politics has never ei118:seen anything as crass as Eliot Spitzer's ei119:willingness to ei120:exploit the unfortunate ei121:murder of Slepian as a steppingstone for his own political ambitions,'' Berhrmann ei122:said.\nSeveral consultants ei123:agreed that there might ei124:be political hay to be ei125:made in Slepian's death but that it ei126:had to be done carefully.\n``ei127:Trying to ei128:score political points from a ei129:homicide can ei130:have a backlash,'' ei131:said Maureen Connelly, a media consultant not ei132:working for any candidate in next week's ei133:election.",

The men were not ei9:termed suspects, and FBI officials on Saturday ei10:played down the likelihood that either was ei11:involved in the Oct. 23 ei12:killing of the doctor, Barnett Slepian.\n``We are ei13:doing dozens if not hundreds of ei14:interviews a day,'' ei15:said Paul Moskal, a spokesman for the FBI office in Buffalo. ``I ei16:know of no information that would ei17:treat these two differently or would ei18:put them in any other category from the hundreds of leads we're ei19:investigating on a daily basis.''\nMoskal ei20:said one of the two men _ he ei21:said he did not ei22:know which one _ had been ei23:located, ei24:interviewed and ei25:released. In its Friday issue, The Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator ei26:quoted an officer in the Amherst, N.Y., Police Department as ei27:saying that the FBI. bulletin had ei28:indicated possible ei29:links between the two men and James Charles Kopp, an abortion opponent who is being ei30:sought as a material witness in the case. Amherst police officials ei31:declined to ei32:comment Saturday.\nSlepian, 52, an obstetrician and gynecologist, was ei33:shot through the kitchen window of his home in Amherst shortly after he and his wife ei34:returned home from synagogue on the night of Friday, Oct. 23. He ei35:was one of three doctors who ei36:performed abortions in the Buffalo area. Investigators in Canada and the United States are also ei37:looking into four other sniper ei38:attacks on doctors who ei39:performed abortions in Canada and western New York.\nMoskal ei40:said the two men apparently ei41:showed up at Slepian's house the day after his ei42:death. They were ei43:trying to ei44:attend a prayer vigil for Slepian but had been ei45:sent to his house by mistake, and a police officer on duty ei46:took their names, Moskal ei47:said. ``They were being ei48:sought for ei49:interviews just because they ei50:were literally in the area after the ei51:homicide,'' he ei52:said.\nFBI officials ei53:said they ei54:were not certain whether Stauber or Gingrich had been ei55:involved in antiabortion activities. The two men are ei56:believed to ei57:live in the Cleveland area.\nInspector Keith MacCaskill of the Winnipeg Police Service, a Canadian member of a law-enforcement task force ei58:investigating all five of the ei59:shootings, ei60:said he had never ei61:heard of the men.\nMoskal ei62:emphasized that no one has been ei63:named as a suspect in Slepian's ei64:death. ``Just the fact that we are ei65:interviewing anyone doesn't ei66:make them a subject or a suspect in this,'' he ei67:said.",

    "text": "INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ei1:embraced three of its former rivals, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland on Friday, formally ei2:ending the Soviet ei3:domination of those nations that ei4:began after World ei5:War II and ei6:opening a new path for the military alliance.\nIn a ei7:ceremony tinged with the personal and the emotional at the Truman Presidential Library here, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ei8:watched the foreign ministers of the three countries ei9:sign the documents of accession to the alliance, ei10:signed them herself and then ei11:held them aloft like a victory trophy.\nAlbright, who was ei12:born in Prague and ei13:fled just after the Communist ei14:takeover in 1948, ei15:made no secret of her joy at her homeland and its neighbors ei16:joining the alliance after a six year trans-Atlantic diplomatic ei17:process ei18:led by the Clinton administration.\n``To ei20:quote an old Central European expression, `Hallelujah,''' she ei19:said.\nIn Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, the moment was ei21:marked by small-scale public ei22:celebrations. In Warsaw, Poland, after dark, as fireworks ei23:lit the sky, the Polish flag and the flag of NATO were ei24:raised side by side near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Pilsudski Square\nIn Hungary, NATO members' flags were ei25:raised outside the Defense Ministry. And in Prague, Czech Republic, President Vaclav Havel ei26:said in a ei27:statement, ``Never have we ei28:been part of such a broad, solid and binding security alliance which at the same time ei29:respects in its essence the ei30:sovereignty and ei31:will of our nation.''\nThe ei32:enlargement of NATO from 16 members to 19 has ei33:been one of the administration's foremost foreign policy goals, one that ei34:grew out of a ei35:desire, its proponents ei36:said, to ei37:cement the democratic ei39:gains made in the former Warsaw Pact countries after the ei38:collapse of communism 10 years ago.\nBut the policy also ei40:faced critics, who ei41:argued that ei42:welcoming these three new countries would ei43:draw a new line across Europe and ei44:antagonize the Russians. As of Friday, the border between Western Europe and the former Soviet Union ei45:moved to the eastern border of Poland.\nIn her ei46:speech, in the small auditorium where dignitaries from the three countries ei47:sat and the three foreign ministers ei48:flanked her on the stage, Albright ei49:countered that NATO would now ei50:do ``for Europe's East what NATO has already ei51:helped to ei52:do for Europe's West. Steadily and systematically, we will ei53:continue ei54:erasing _ without ei55:replacing _ the line ei56:drawn in Europe by Stalin's bloody boot.''\nAlbright also ei59:used her ei60:speech to ei61:articulate a forward-looking vision for NATO, which will ei62:celebrate its 50th anniversary in Washington next month, and to ei63:defend NATO's potential ei64:involvement in Kosovo.\nIn the ei66:aftermath of the Cold War, she ei65:said, NATO must be ei67:ready to ei68:face ``an aggressive regime, a rampaging faction, or a terrorist group. And we ei70:know that if, past is prologue, we ei71:face a future in which weapons will ei72:be more destructive at longer distances than ever before.''\nThe NATO ei73:summit, she ei74:said, would ei75:produce an ei76:initiative that ``ei77:responds to the grave threat ei78:posed by weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.''\nIn Kosovo, where the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, is ei79:resisting the ei80:deployment of NATO-led troops, including 4,000 U.S. soldiers, Albright ei81:insisted that NATO ei82:was the best tool to ei83:enforce a peace ei84:settlement.\n``We must ei105:be clear in ei86:explaining that a ei87:settlement without NATO-led ei88:enforcement ei89:is not acceptable because only NATO ei90:has the credibility and capability to ei91:make it ei92:work,'' she ei104:said. ``And we must ei96:be resolute in ei97:spelling out the ei98:consequences of intransigence,'' she ei99:added, ei100:referring to the threat of NATO air ei101:strikes against Milosevic if he does not ei102:agree to the ei103:deployment.\nBut in many ways, the day ei106:belonged to the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, who in order to ei107:meet NATO's standards have ei110:had to ei108:cut the size of their Soviet-style militaries, ei109:organize civilian control of their armies and ei111:agree to ei112:buy NATO compatible equipment in the coming years.\nIt was the spiritual ei113:homecoming to the West that all three foreign ministers ei114:stressed.\n``Poland forever ei115:returns where she has always ei116:belonged _ the free world,'' ei117:said Bronislaw Geremek, the foreign minister of Poland, who ei118:was a dissident during the Communist ei119:era.\nGeremek ei120:said he had ei121:brought some appropriate mementoes from Poland to the Truman library, including a campaign poster from 1989 when the anti-communist Solidarity forces ei122:won against the Communists. The poster ei123:showed a picture of Gary Cooper from the film ``High Noon.''\n``It ei124:helped us to ei125:win,'' Geremek ei223:said. ``For the people of Poland, high noon ei126:comes today.''\nThe Czech foreign minister, Jan Kavan, who ei127:lived in London from 1968, when the Soviets ei128:invaded Czechoslovakia, until 1989, ei129:said he had ei130:remained buoyant during his opposition ei131:work as an emigre by ei132:believing that communism would eventually ei133:fall. But he never ei134:dreamed, he ei135:said, that his country would ei136:become a member of NATO.\n``ei137:Accession to NATO is a ei138:guarantee that we will never again ei139:become powerless victims of any foreign aggression,'' Kavan ei141:said.\nSimilarly, the Hungarian foreign minister, Janos Martonyi, who ei142:remembers the 1956 ei143:uprising as a 13-year-old, ei144:said that membership of NATO ei145:meant that Hungary was ei146:returning ``to her natural habitat.''\n``It has ei147:been our manifest destiny to ei148:rejoin those with whom we ei149:share the same values, interests and goals,'' he ei150:said.\nBut Martonyi also ei151:emphasized that Hungary ei152:understood NATO membership ei153:carried with it obligations as well as privileges. ``We shall ei154:prove that new members can indeed ei155:add to the weight of the alliance,'' he ei156:said.\nThe location for Friday's ei157:ceremony was ei158:chosen by Albright, who as secretary of state ei159:is the depository of NATO's accession accords.\nThe secretary made the fairly unorthodox ei160:decision to ei161:choose a site outside Washington because she ei162:wanted the ei163:ceremony to ei164:resonate with the memories of President Truman, under whom NATO was ei165:founded. On April 4, 1949, on behalf of the United States, Truman's secretary of state, Dean Acheson, ei166:signed the Washington Treaty, which ei167:created NATO. Acheson is Albright's favorite predecessor, her aides ei168:said.\nei169:Formed in reaction to the threat of the Soviet Union under Stalin, NATO ei170:calls for the collective ei171:defense of its members and was ei172:brought into being with an original 12 members.\nThe alliance has ei173:expanded three times before, ei174:adding Greece and Turkey in 1952, West Germany in 1955 and Spain in 1982. But never before has NATO ei175:reached out to its former Eastern-bloc enemies.\nThe Clinton administration ei176:embarked on the ei177:expansion of NATO in 1993 after Clinton ei178:met in Washington with President Havel and Lech Walesa, who ei179:was then the president of Poland.\nThese ei180:conversations are ei181:remembered by Clinton's foreign policy team because they ei182:took place after the ei183:opening of the Holocaust Museum and because they ei184:involved two very different Central European leaders who ei185:brought the same message.\nTheir ei224:message was that NATO should be ei186:used as the mechanism to ei187:secure the democratic progress of their countries and at the same ei188:dissuade Russia from any more imperial designs.\nThe U.S. ambassador to Poland, Dan Fried, who ei190:was then on the National Security Council, ei189:said Friday that he ei191:remembered being ei192:asked to ei193:help ``ei194:turn this pious wish into a policy.''\nIn July 1997, at a ei195:summit in Madrid, Spain, the alliance ei196:announced it would ei197:accept Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Romania and Slovenia, which had ei198:tried hard to ei199:meet the standards, were ei200:turned away, at least for the time being.\nOne problem was how to ei201:deal with the Russians, who ei202:vacillated between outright hostility and accepting what ei203:looked like the inevitable. In early 1997, President Boris Yeltsin ei205:told President Clinton he could ei206:live with NATO ei207:expansion. But in order to accommodate the Russians, NATO ei208:created the NATO-Russia Council as a consultative body that ei209:formalized relations between Moscow and the alliance.\nPoland has ei210:been sensitive to the ei211:reactions of Russia to its membership of NATO, and Geremek has ei212:gone out of his way to ei213:reassure the Russians. ``We ei214:want our membership of NATO to ei215:serve as a `catalyst' for Polish Russian co-operation,'' he ei216:said last year.\nEven so, on the secretary of state's plane carrying Albright and the three foreign ministers to the ei217:ceremony Friday, the ministers were ei218:asked whether they could ever ei219:foresee Russia as a member of NATO.\nThere was a long ei220:pause among the three ministers. Then Martonyi ei221:replied: ``ei222:Silence is your answer.''",

    "text": "With the ei1:finding of a buried rifle 11 days ago, the authorities in the Buffalo, N.Y., area ei2:say they have ei3:gathered enough evidence in the October ei4:slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian to ei5:begin ei6:presenting a murder case to a state grand jury as early as next week.\nA federal grand jury has already been ei7:addressing the ei8:slaying under laws that ei9:prohibit ei10:violence against providers of abortion. Slepian ei11:was the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic before he was ei12:shot to death last Oct. 23 at his home in suburban Amherst. But the ei13:decision by District Attorney Frank C. Clark to ei14:begin ei15:presenting evidence to a state grand jury ei16:suggests that he has ei17:amassed enough material to ei18:support a criminal indictment for homicide.\n``We've ei19:gotten to the point where we ei20:know what we ei21:want to ei22:introduce before a grand jury,'' Clark ei23:said in a telephone ei24:interview Monday.\nAlthough the authorities are not ei25:saying who the suspect ei26:is, all of the attention so far has ei27:fallen on James C. Kopp, a 44-year-old anti-abortion protester who had been ei28:traveling around the country from demonstration to demonstration for years.\nOfficially, Kopp is being ei29:sought as a ``material witness'' in the case.\nClark ei30:said it was easier to ei31:seek ei32:extradition of an indicted suspect from another state or a foreign country than of someone ei33:wanted as a material witness. For now, though, that would ei34:be a theoretical advantage since the authorities have ei35:admitted they ei36:have no idea where Kopp ei37:is.\nClark ei38:said there was ``no question'' that the ei39:finding of the rifle ei40:was important in his ei41:decision to ei42:seek an ei43:indictment. The rifle was ei44:discovered April 8 ei45:buried one foot below the ground, about 200 feet behind Slepian's house. It is ei46:undergoing testing at the FBI laboratory in Washington, but the authorities have ei47:said it ei48:resembles the kind of high-powered rifle ei49:used in the ei50:slaying.\nClark ei51:said other evidence that prosecutors might ei52:present ei53:includes a strand of human hair ei54:found at the wooded firing site that has a ``high likelihood'' of ei55:matching Kopp's hair and testimony from a jogger who ei56:spotted Kopp's car near Slepian's house at 6 a.m. ten days before the ei57:shooting. There also are videotapes of Kopp's car ei58:crossing the Canadian border around the days _ in 1994, 1995 and 1997 _ that three Canadian doctors who ei59:perform abortions were ei60:shot at. None of those doctors were ei61:killed.\nIf a suspect is ei62:caught and ei63:charged in both state and federal courts, a state trial would likely ei64:precede a federal one, ei65:giving the authorities two chances to ei66:prosecute. New York State double-jeopardy laws would ei67:make it difficult to ei68:prosecute a suspect who had been ei69:found not guilty at a federal trial.\nU.S. Attorney Denise E. O'Donnell ei70:declined to ei71:discuss what federal charges were being ei72:pursued, but she ei73:said that in a case like this, potential charges would ei74:be abortion-related ei75:violence, the ei76:use of a firearm in an ei77:act of violence, ei78:crossing state lines to ei79:commit a crime, and, if the suspect's act was ei80:tied to an organization, violation of the so-called RICO statutes, which ei81:prohibit an organized criminal enterprise.\nSlepian, 52, and the father of four boys, was ei82:shot to death at 10 p.m. as he ei83:stood ei84:chatting with his wife in the kitchen of their home in an affluent enclave in Amherst, which ei85:is the largest Buffalo suburb.",

Erie County District Attorney Frank Clark, Bernard Tolbert, the special FBI agent in charge of the Buffalo office, and other investigators will also ei25:be there.\nSince there ei26:is no federal homicide statute as such, the federal officials ei27:said Kopp could be ei28:charged under the recent Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which ei29:provides for a ei30:sentence of up to life imprisonment for someone ei31:convicted of physical ei32:assaults or ei33:threats against abortion providers. If Kopp were also ei34:indicted and ei35:convicted on state murder charges, he could ei36:face the death penalty.\nSlepian, a 52-year-old obstetrician and gynecologist who ei37:was the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic, was ei38:shot to death on the night of Oct. 23 as he ei39:stood in the kitchen of his home in suburban Amherst, N.Y. ei40:chatting with his wife and one of his four sons.\nNo weapon was ei41:recovered in the first police searches of the area around Slepian's home. But on April 8, investigators, ei42:wondering how the assailant could have ei43:emerged from the woods without ei44:fearing he would be ei45:seen ei46:carrying a rifle, ei47:searched the site of the ei48:shooting once more and ei49:unearthed a rifle ei50:buried one foot below ground 200 feet behind the Slepian home.\nClark, the Erie district attorney, ei51:said afterwards that investigators ei52:think the doctor's killer ei53:buried the rifle in the days before the ei55:shooting, ei56:unearthed the weapon to ei57:fire the fatal shots, then hurriedly ei58:reburied it and ei59:fled.\nThe 44-year-old Kopp, who in FBI photographs ei60:appears as gaunt and scruffily bearded and whose last known addresses ei61:were in Vermont and New Jersey, ei62:emerged as the focus of the investigation within two weeks of the ei63:slaying. A jogger ei64:observed Kopp's car at 6 a.m. near Slepian's home 10 days before the ei65:murder, and, ei66:curious why a stranger would be ei67:parked there so early, ei68:wrote down the license plate number.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON _\nA six-year-old boy who ei1:arrived on US shores as a motherless refugee and ei2:became a political symbol for anti-Castro exiles must be ei3:returned to his father in Cuba, immigration authorities ei4:ruled Wednesday.\nFaced with the choice of keeping Elian Gonzalez with relatives in Miami, where the boy has been ei6:wooed with American toys and theme-park ei94:visits, or ei7:returning him to his apparently distraught father in Havana, the Immigration and Naturalization Service ei137:decided the boy should ei8:go home by Jan. 14, INS commissioner Doris Meissner ei9:told reporters.\n``This little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with his father,'' Meissner ei11:told a news ei95:conference. ``The core issue here is the bond between the parent and the child.''\nThe ei97:decision was ei12:met with outrage by Cuban-Americans, who ei13:said the youngster will ei14:suffer under the repressive communist regime of Fidel Castro. Lawyers for the boy's family in Miami ei15:sent letters of protest to Attorney General Janet Reno and President Clinton and ei16:said they were ei17:prepared to ei18:file a court ei100:appeal if Reno and Clinton ei19:spurn the Gonzalez family.\nAnti-Castro demonstrators ei138:thronged the street near the local INS office in Miami Wednesday, ei20:demanding that Elian be ei21:allowed to ei22:stay.\n``Today is a sad day for the US Constitution . . . and for the hopes and dreams of Elian's mother Elizabeth,'' who ei139:died with nine other adults when their boat ei23:sank as they ei24:attempted to ei25:reach Florida, ei26:said Roger Bernstein, ei27:representing the Miami Gonzalez family.\n``Nobody ei28:wants the boy to be ei140:separated from his father,'' ei29:said Ninoska Perez of the Miami-based Cuban-American National Foundation. ``But that little boy, by ei31:surviving two days on an inner tube, has ei141:earned the right to ei32:stay here in freedom.''\nIn Havana, the government ei33:gave a guarded first ei105:response to the INS ei106:ruling, ei107:warning against ``excessive optimism'' and ei35:predicting ``the Cuban-American mafia and the extreme right in the U.S. Congress'' would still ei36:put up a ei109:fight to ei37:keep the boy.\nMeissner ei38:said the INS ei110:decision was made after two lengthy ei111:interviews with the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, a hotel worker in Cardenas, Cuba, who Meissner ei40:said is anxious to have Elian ei41:returned to him.\nSince the boy is so young, Meissner ei42:said, the natural father has the right to ei43:speak for Elian.\nThere is ``no information'' that Gonzalez, who was ei44:divorced from Elian's mother, is an unfit father, nor that he has been ei142:coerced by the Castro regime into ei45:pleading for his son's ei112:return, Meissner ei46:said.\nSpencer Eig, an attorney for the Gonzalez family in Miami, ei47:said Meissner's assumptions were ``unconstitutional and untrue.''\n``Elian cannot ei143:apply for asylum from persecution by the Fidel Castro government,'' Eig complained. ``If only his father, who is under the control of the Fidel Castro regime, can ei48:do it for him . . . that is deeply unfair and untrue.''\nMeissner ei49:gave no reason for the Jan. 14 deadline, and it is still unclear how Elian would be ei50:transported back to Cuba if the Gonzalez family's ei116:appeals are unsuccessful.\nThe INS ei51:offered three options: that Gonzalez ei52:come to ei53:pick up his son, that the family in Miami ei117:take him to Cuba, or that a ``third party'' ei118:escort the child to his homeland.\nGonzalez _ perhaps under duress from the Castro regime _ has ei54:indicated he does not ei55:want to ei56:travel to Miami, and there is ``no way'' the Miami Gonzalezes will ei57:assist in ei58:sending Elian back to Cuba, Perez ei59:said.\nHaving a third party ei144:escort Elian ei60:frees the INS from the politically uncomfortable spectacle of having to ei61:do the task itself. The Cuban-American lobby is a locally powerful political force few politicians ei62:want to ei63:provoke.\nClinton has ei64:sought to distance himself from the ei122:controversy from the ei123:start. ``I ei65:told you when we ei66:started this I would ei67:do my best to ei68:keep the ei124:decision out of politics,'' Clinton ei69:told reporters in the Rose Garden Wednesday. ``We have done that.''\nBut if Elian is ei70:forced to ei71:go back to Cuba, ``the Clinton-Gore administration, specifically (Vice President) Al Gore, will ei72:pay a high price in terms of votes in Florida,'' Perez ei73:said.\nCuba experts and child custody lawyers ei74:said the INS ei129:ruling was appropriate under the law.\n``It's high time'' the boy was ei75:sent back to his birthplace, ei76:said Wayne Smith, a former Clinton administration adviser on Cuba. ``This was a simple child custody case.''\n``Every state court and every family court in the United States would ei133:award custody to a surviving parent rather than a distant relative who ei78:lives a more prosperous life,'' ei79:said David Abraham, a professor at Miami Law School and expert in custody law.\n``We may have the Disneylands and the Universal Studios and all the things that were ei80:dangled before the little boy's eyes,'' Abraham added. ``But that's his home.''\nWith the political implications so strong, it's unlikely the case of Elian Gonzalez will be ei81:closed quickly, ei82:said Richard Nuccio, a former Clinton administration Cuba adviser.\n``With two members of Congress ei83:representing Elian's family's constituency, I don't ei85:see how Elian could be ei86:returned by the federal government without it ei87:going through the court system,'' Nuccio ei88:said.",

    "text": "The New York Times ei1:says in an editorial on Thursday, Jan. 6: &QL;\nThe U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service ei2:made a reasonable ei47:decision Wednesday in ei48:ruling that Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy who ei3:survived an ill-fated migrant smuggling ei50:trip across the Florida Straits, should be ei72:reunited with his father back in Cuba. The ei51:decision will ei5:inflame anti-Castro Cubans in Miami, but Doris Meissner, the INS commissioner, ei6:made it clear that the service had ei7:followed established policy in the case. Moreover, by ei9:setting a Jan. 14 ei52:return date, the immigration service ei10:allowed Elian's American relatives time to ei11:test the ei54:ruling in court.\nElian was one of 13 Cubans who were ei12:trying to ei13:cross from Cuba to Florida six weeks ago on a 17-foot aluminum powerboat when it ei14:capsized. Ten of those on board ei73:died, including his mother and stepfather. The boy ei16:clung to an inner tube for two days and was ei17:plucked from the Atlantic on Thanksgiving Day and ei18:brought ashore. He was immediately ei19:released into the custody of relatives in Miami _ and just as quickly ei20:embraced as a pawn in the poisonous estrangement between Fidel Castro's regime and its opponents in exile.\nThis page has ei21:argued from the ei59:start that Elian not be ei22:denied due process because of his youth, and the INS ei23:appears to have ei24:moved carefully. Elian's great-uncle and other American relatives were ei25:allowed to ei26:make their case that he should have a life in Miami. The boy's ei27:divorced father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was also ei28:interviewed and ei74:satisfied the agency that he had a close and involved relationship with his son. The mother's parents also ei29:argued for a ei61:return to Cuba. The INS ei75:decided that under their prevailing policies, Gonzalez ei30:met the test that calls for custody ei32:reverting to the sole surviving parent in such cases.\n``This little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with his father,'' Meissner ei35:said Wednesday, ei76:adding that ``the unique relationship between parent and child and family reunification has long been a cornerstone of both American immigration law and INS practice.'' The White House quickly ei36:announced support for the ei68:decision.\nIt is unclear how the political side of this affair will ei37:play out. Elian's relatives in Miami have ei38:indicated they ei39:plan to ei40:appeal, as is their right. Some of their more militant supporters in Miami, ei77:decrying the prospect that the boy will be ei41:used as a ``trophy'' by Castro, have ei42:indicated they may ei43:try to ei44:disrupt efforts to ei78:reunite Elian with his father. That would be ei45:treating the boy as a trophy in a diplomatic ei70:struggle that predates his ei71:birth by decades.",

    "text": "ATLANTA _\nGood for Attorney General Janet Reno for the sensible opinion she ei1:rendered in the case of Elian Gonzalez. Some semblance of constitutional order was necessary after a Miami judge ei2:turned legal logic on its head in an effort to ei66:route to her family court his Florida relatives' ei40:appeal to ei4:keep the 6-year-old in the United States.\nImmigration, after all, is strictly a federal matter. If the Immigration and Naturalization Service ei41:order that Elian must be ei5:returned to his father in Cuba is to be ei6:contested, Reno ei7:ruled correctly that the only proper venue is federal court, not state or local.\nIf and when the relatives' ei42:appeal ei9:goes to federal court, chances of a favorable ei43:ruling are slim. First of all, the INS already has ei10:taken the position the only person who can ei11:petition for U.S. asylum for Elian is his father, which he is not about to ei12:do. Moreover, immigration law ei13:provides that asylum can only be ei14:granted where there is an imminent threat of ei67:torture or ei68:persecution in the petitioner's homeland, which nobody ei16:expects in Elian's case.\nIt's not enough to ei17:argue Elian may ei18:suffer ei69:privation or ei70:oppression in Fidel Castro's ei19:failed Communist state. The INS routinely ei20:sends prospective immigrants back to countries where poverty and tyranny are worse than in Cuba.\nWhat matters most is that Elian, after ei21:losing his mother and stepfather in a disastrous sea ei54:voyage to the United States last November, ei22:needs the love and care of surviving family members who've known him all his life _ his father and both sets of grandparents in Cuba. True, they can't ei25:give him all the material things his Miami benefactors can, but there are intangibles in close family bonds that are more valuable than bicycles and ei59:trips to Disney World.\nThe next order of business for the Justice Department and the INS is to ei26:resolve Elian's case promptly. They mustn't ei71:countenance any delays by lawyers for his Miami relatives. He has been ei72:separated from his loved ones too long.\nBesides, the longer his ei62:return is ei28:put off, the greater the chance of ei63:interference by calculating congressmen ei30:playing to the anti-Castro lobby. Already one grandstanding Indiana Republican has ei73:subpoenaed Elian to testify before a House panel, and others in the Senate are ei31:preparing to ei32:vote the boy U.S. citizenship. Both ei64:ploys are ei33:intended to ei34:thwart his ei65:reunion with his father.\nCongress reconvenes Jan. 24. The Justice Department and the INS mustn't ei35:allow the opportunists of Capitol Hill to ei36:get their hooks into Elian.",

    "text": "MIAMI _\nThe angry crowd ei1:rushed at Manuel Gonzalez as he ei2:stepped out of Miami's federal courthouse, ei3:shaking fists at him and ei189:shouting in Spanish, ``communista'' and ``traitor.''\nBut the great-uncle of 6-year-old ei130:shipwreck survivor rafter Elian Gonzalez only ei4:ducked his head and ei5:walked faster.\nIn a drama that has ei190:divided his once close-knit family and may finally be ei7:resolved in a court ei132:hearing the week of March 6, Manuel Gonzalez, 59, a soft-spoken bus mechanic, has remained largely out of the glare of television lights.\nUntil this week.\nHe was ei10:thrust into the middle of the ei191:swirling Gonzalez family saga when Elian's father, Juan Miguel, ei11:sent a letter to U.S. Attorney Janet Reno ei12:asking that his son be ei13:moved to Manuel Gonzalez's home.\nAlone among his two brothers and two sisters who have ei14:fled Cuba for Miami, Manuel Gonzalez ei15:believes Elian should ei16:go back to Cuba to ei17:live with his father.\nReno ei18:denied the ei134:request, but Manuel Gonzalez didn't ei192:back down.\nIn a town where ei19:expressing even the slightest approval for Cuban President Fidel Castro can ei20:prompt threats of physical harm, Manuel Gonzalez ei21:filed a motion in federal court ei22:asking for custody of Elian so that he could ei23:help ei193:reunite the boy with his father in Cuba.\nIt was a move that many ei24:see as courageous and principled, but others fear may be foolhardy.\n``I have ei26:lost a son,'' Gonzalez ei27:told reporters later, ei28:referring to his own son's ei141:death due to cancer. ``I am ei29:supporting Juan Miguel because I ei30:know what it is to ei31:lose a son. Elian should be with his father.''\nHis sincerity didn't ei143:stop the talk on Little Havana's streets or on Miami's ubiquitous Spanish-language radio stations, which ei32:buzzed with callers ei194:lambasting Gonzalez for ei33:playing into the hands of a tyrant.\nA day after he was ei195:hounded on the steps of the federal courthouse, Manuel Gonzalez wouldn't ei34:come to the door of his modest home in Miami's Little Havana.\n``He must ei35:go to ei36:work,'' ei37:said his daughter, Rosa, who ei38:said Gonzalez would ei39:prefer not to ei40:talk about the issue. ``There has been a lot of pressure, and he feels this is a family affair.''\nAfter weeks of high-profile public ei147:sparring _ with charges of ei149:abuse, ei42:spying and ei150:treachery ei43:flying back and forth across the Florida Straits _ it would ei44:seem the chances are slim that the Gonzalez family could ever ei196:heal the wounds ei45:created by the Elian saga.\nBut the family has ei46:overcome steep obstacles before. Long before Elian ei152:thrust them into the unrelenting glare of the international spotlight, the Gonzalez clan was a typical example of the ei154:conflicts and painful ei155:separations ei47:wrought by the Cuban ei156:revolution.\nOf the nine brothers and sisters of Manuel's generation, five have ei48:come to Miami, while three remain in Cuba and one has ei50:passed away.\nAccording to press ei158:reports, Caridad Gonzalez, the oldest sister, was the first to ei52:come to the United States, ei53:arriving in 1966. Her brother Delfin, who was ei54:imprisoned as an anti-Castro activist in the 1960s, ei55:followed in 1979. Then ei56:came another sister, Georgina, in 1983, ei57:followed by Manuel and Lazaro in 1984.\nOf those who ei58:stayed in Cuba, Juan Miguel's father, Juan Gonzalez, ei59:seems the most closely allied with the Cuban government. He ei60:worked as a police officer in a Cuban ministry, a position that probably ei61:helped his son _ Elian's father _ ei62:get a job in the Communist island's increasingly lucrative tourism industry.\nThe family's ei161:experience is like that of thousands of others now split between Miami and Cuba, ei63:said Damien Fernandez, a Cuban-American political scientist at Florida International University.\n``Cubans value their families above almost anything, but the post-1959 politics have ei64:managed to ei65:split thousands of families apart,'' he ei66:said.\nFor decades, Cuban Americans in Miami were largely ei67:cut off from the families they ei68:left behind. Labeled ``worms'' and ``traitors'' by Castro, many weren't able to ei69:speak to _ much less ei164:visit _ their relatives for years.\nThe situation ei70:began to ei71:relax in the early 1990s, with the ei166:crisis ei72:triggered by the ei167:end of the former Soviet Union's subsidies. In desperate need of hard currency, Castro ei73:relaxed travel restrictions and ei74:allowed Cubans to have U.S. dollars, ei75:triggering a trickle of cash from Miami that soon ei77:became a flood.\nBy some estimates, the 700,000 Cubans living in South Florida _ and elsewhere in the United States _ ei79:send $1 billion a year in remittances back to their families on the island.\n``The Miami families have ei80:become a lifeline, and since 1990 there has been a great trend toward ei174:reconciliation,'' ei81:said Florida International's Fernandez. ``Although many families are still divided by politics, they have ei82:learned to ei83:forgive and ei84:forget and ei85:find common ground.''\nPrior to Elian, the Gonzalez family apparently was no different. The branches of the family regularly ei86:talked by telephone and the Miami relatives ei87:went back to Cuba for several family ei88:reunions.\nBut Elian's case has ei89:broken down the family's fragile truce, with their political differences ei90:exacerbated by the inflammatory rhetoric ei91:flying between Castro's government and exile extremists in Miami.\nAfter making his opinions known, Manuel Gonzalez reportedly was ei94:ostracized by his Miami kin, especially Lazaro, who has been ei95:keeping Elian and who has ei96:gone to court to ei98:try to ei99:keep the boy here.\nBut there has been at least one ei178:attempt at a ei179:resolution. The day before last Tuesday's federal court ei180:hearing, Manuel ei100:went to Lazaro's home to ei101:try to ei102:work out their differences. Neither side would ei103:say what ei104:happened, but when Manuel ei105:returned to his house, he was so upset he ei106:felt heart palpitations and was ei107:taken to a hospital.\nHe was soon ei108:released and ei109:appeared to be reasonably healthy when he ei110:appeared in court the next morning. But while Cuban exiles outside the courthouse ei111:cheered Lazaro and his family, their angry taunts ei112:seemed to ei113:shock Manuel.\nHis lawyer, however, ei114:insists he will ei115:continue to ei116:stand up for what he ei117:thinks is right.\n``He's a strong man,'' ei118:said Jeffrey Leving. ``He won't ei119:let anyone ei120:intimidate him from ei121:doing what is in Elian's best interests.''\nTo his credit, Lazaro Gonzalez has ei122:issued a statement ei123:asking Miami's exiles to ei124:respect his brother's opinions.\nManuel Gonzalez has ei125:told reporters that he ei126:believes his family will ei127:recover _ at least partially _ from the divisions Elian's case has ei128:brought.\n``The wounds of the problem will ei197:heal,'' he ei129:told the Los Angeles Times newspaper. ``But the scars will always be there.''",

    "text": "MIAMI _\nElected officials in and around Miami ei1:warned U.S. immigration officials Wednesday that they should ei2:expect little help from the police here when they ei3:come for 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, and they ei4:said this city could ei5:erupt in violence if federal agents ei6:tried to forcibly ei7:take the boy from his great-uncle's house in Little Havana and ei8:send him back to Cuba.\n``We will not ei9:lend our respective resources, whether they be in the form of police officers or any other resources, to ei10:assist the federal government in any way, shape or form to inappropriately ei11:repatriate Elian Gonzalez to Cuba,'' ei12:said Alex Penelas, mayor of Miami-Dade County.\nAs of Wednesday evening, Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle and temporary guardian, still had not ei13:signed an agreement to ei14:hand the child over to immigration officials if the Miami relatives ei15:lose a ei62:fight to ei16:keep him when the case is ei17:heard in May in the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.\n``I won't ei18:cooperate in anything,'' Gonzalez ei19:told a Spanish-language television station. ``The boy lives in my house, and they'll have to ei20:go ei21:find him there.''\nAs pressure ei22:built in this city, the home of a large number of Cuban exiles, officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service ei23:said they did not ei24:plan to ei25:remove Elian on Thursday morning even if his Miami relatives ei26:continued to ei72:defy them. But an INS spokeswoman ei27:said the agency would ei28:revoke Elian's permission to ei29:stay in the United States, ei67:clearing the way for his ei68:return to Cuba.\nIn Havana, Cuban President Fidel Castro ei30:said that the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, would ei31:travel to the United States to ei32:bring his son home after the custody ei70:battle has been ei73:decided in the courts. Elian's father would be ei33:accompanied by other family members from Cuba, some of the boy's former classmates and teachers, and psychiatric experts, Castro ei34:said on Cuban television.\n``We have the perfect formula for ei35:reinserting Elian,'' Castro ei36:said. He also ei37:said that the group would be willing to ei38:wait as long as it takes to ei40:bring the boy back.\nAsked to ei41:comment on Castro's ei71:announcement, a Justice Department spokesman ei42:said:\n``Certainly it ei43:changes things. How it ei44:changes things is a little hard to ei45:say at this point. If the father ei46:shows up in Miami and decides to ei47:go and ei48:ring the doorbell of his relatives and ei49:find his son, well, the family in Miami is on record as ei50:saying they would ei51:turn over Elian to him. Whether they actually ei52:do this remains to be ei74:seen.''",

    "text": "MIAMI _\nEven miles away from sign-waving demonstrators who ei2:keep vigil outside the tiny house in Little Havana where Elian Gonzalez lives with his great-uncle, ei3:talk about the ei106:standoff between Elian's Miami relatives and Immigration and Naturalization Service officials ei146:pours hot and quick from coffee stands on Calle Ocho and any other place Cuban Americans ei5:gather.\nIn rapid-fire Spanish, so fast that even people who ei6:learned the language in other Hispanic cultures can have trouble ei7:keeping up, they ei147:villify Attorney General Janet Reno, President Clinton and others who ei8:want to ei9:send the child back to his father in Cuba. And they ei10:question _ or ei108:ridicule _ news that the boy's father is ei11:planning to ei12:come here to ei13:retrieve his son.\nIt is a Communist plot ei148:hatched by the hated dictator, Fidel Castro, they ei14:say. If you are not Cuban, they ei15:said, you just would not ei16:understand.\n``If it weren't Cuba, the child should ei17:go to be with his father,'' ei18:said Delfina Miranda, 49, who ei19:works at a beauty salon in Little Havana. ``But it is Cuba. That kid will ei20:get nothing in Cuba. Well, maybe electro-shock treatment, so they can ei149:brain-wash him.''\nOver and over, Cuban Americans ei22:said that outsiders who did not ei23:suffer under the Castro regime simply could not ei24:understand their passions in the Elian ei111:standoff.\nAs talk on the streets ei150:swirled, ei25:talks between lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives and government officials ei26:crept to an uneventful ei151:close.\nU.S. Immigration officials ei27:postponed until Tuesday morning any action on ei28:revoking the boy's temporary permission to ei29:stay in the United States, which would ei30:allow federal officials to, ultimately, ei31:take the boy from his relatives' house and eventually ei152:return him to Cuba. ``Like the family, we are ei32:monitoring ei115:developments concerning the possible ei116:arrival of (Elian's father) Juan Miguel Gonzalez in the United States,'' ei34:said Robert Wallis, INS director for the Miami district.\nGovernment officials had ei35:threatened to ei36:revoke the boy's parole if his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, did not ei37:sign a document ei38:agreeing to ei39:hand Elian over to federal officials once the family's ei118:appeal in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was ei153:decided.\nBut that ei119:standoff ei40:became less important in the eyes of Cuban Americans here after Castro ei41:announced Wednesday that the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is ready to ei42:travel to the United States to ei43:take his son home.\nGonzalez's lawyer, Greg Craig, ei44:asked for a visa Thursday for his client for the expected ei120:visit, but was ei46:told by U.S. State Department officials that Gonzalez himself had to ei154:apply for the visa at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana.\n``Juan Miguel Gonzalez is ready at a moment's notice to ei47:come to the United States,'' ei48:said Craig.\nBut in Miami, many Cuban Americans ei49:said Castro is ei50:orchestrating the ei123:visit.\nCastro ei51:said Gonzalez would ei52:travel with his current wife and their son, a top government official, doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, Elian's Cuban kindergarten teacher, classmates and his old school desk.A list of 31 people ei53:issued by the Cuban government Thursday included Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly. Castro has ei55:suggested that Elian and his relatives ei56:stay at the residence of Cuba's chief diplomat in Washington.\nHidden in the entourage, ei57:cautioned Cuban Americans here, will be Cuban security agents who will ei58:make sure that Gonzalez _ and everyone else, for that matter _ does not ei127:defect.\n``They are ei59:coming with everyone, including psychologists,'' ei61:said Armando Sanjurjo, 73. ``You ei62:know why? To ei63:give Elian an injection and ei64:take him back to Cuba.''\nSanjurjo, ei155:sipping a cafecito in front of Versailles restaurant, the nerve center for Cuban political discussions here in Little Havana, is ei156:convinced, like many others here, the entourage is ei65:designed to ei66:prevent any ei131:defections.\n``He's ei67:coming with an entire court of people? What's that about?'' ei68:said Angela Esparragera, 71.\nMiranda ei69:said Elian's father will be ``a virtual prisoner here if he ei70:comes with all those people. He'll be surrounded by people if he ei71:goes to the bathroom.''\nGloria Estefan, the wildly popular singer of Cuban descent who has ei72:become an entertainment and cultural icon, was also suspicious of this ei134:visit.\n``If in fact, Elian's father is ei73:permitted by the dictatorship of Fidel Castro to ei74:come to the United States, then, as a Cuban American, I ei75:welcome him and ei76:urge him to ei77:make all his ei135:decisions based on the well being and best interest of his son, and not that of the Cuban government,'' Estefan ei79:said.\nAll week, elected officials in Washington, D.C., and at the state capital in Tallahassee have ei81:issued ei137:statement of support for Elian's Miami relatives, even Vice President Al Gore, ei82:breaking from his own administration's stand. In Miami-Dade County, elected officials ei84:went as far as to ei85:say they their police departments would have no role in ei86:taking the boy from the house.\nAmong non-Cuban Americans, there was a drastic shift in their feelings on the case.\n``ei158:Send him back,'' ei87:said Marsha Raeber, 47, an airline employee. ``There are rules and regulations in this country. Some people are ei88:born rich, some people are ei89:born poor. That's the luck of the ei145:draw. Who's to ei90:say that he's better off at Disney World and ei91:eating fast food here instead if breathing the fresh air of Cuba.''\nEric Pichardo, 44, is from Nicaragua, and ei92:said the Cuban-Americans ``ei93:need to ei94:follow the law. What about all the other poor kids in South and Central America?''\nNot all Cuban-Americans ei95:insist that Elian be ei96:allowed to ei97:stay. Diana de Cardenas, 33, was ei98:born in Cuba in 1984. ``I ei99:think he deserves to be with his father,'' she ei100:said. ``It would be ideal if his father ei101:came,'' and then ei102:stayed, in Miami.",

    "text": "MIAMI _\nWith a tense Miami ei1:waiting, federal immigration officials ei2:said Monday they will ei3:order the Miami relatives of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez to ei4:turn the boy over to his father , who could ei5:come to the U.S. from Cuba as early as Tuesday.\n``Our goal is to ei141:reunite Elian and his father,'' ei6:said Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. ``The issue is not whether we will ei7:transfer Elian to his father, but when and how.''\nLate Monday, U.S. State Department officials ei8:said that travel visas had been ei9:approved for Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his immediate family and three other people _ a pediatrician, a psychologist and one of Elian's favorite cousins. The group might ei10:come to the U.S. as soon as Tuesday, according to unconfirmed media reports.\nBut Miami's volatile Cuban exiles ei12:continued to ei142:vow they would ei13:block any ei110:attempt to ei14:take Elian from the Little Havana home where he has been living with his Miami relatives, with some ei16:predicting bloodshed if federal agents ei18:come for the boy.\n``There will be thousands here to ei19:stop it if they ei20:come for him,'' ei21:said Ana Bonnin, one of about 100 exiles who ei22:practiced ei23:forming a human chain outside the home Monday. ``We'll ei24:try to ei25:do it peacefully, but you can only ei26:do so much. You can't ei27:control everybody.''\nLate in the day, lawyers for Elian's Miami family ei28:emerged from their third day-long ei112:meeting with federal officials, but ei29:said little.\n``We ei30:continue to be very concerned about the mental and psychological well-being of this 6-year-old,'' ei31:said Manny Diaz, one of the family's attorneys. ``To that end, we'll be back tomorrow to ei32:continue our ei114:negotiations.''\nFederal officials made no immediate comment.\nIt was not clear whether the Gonzalez family would ei34:come to Miami to ei35:get Elian or if instead they would ei36:travel to Washington, D.C.\nCuban President Fidel Castro has ei37:said they would ei38:live in the home of a Cuban diplomat in the Washington area until the court case surrounding Elian's fate is ei39:resolved.\nVisas for the entourage of more than 20 teachers, classmates and others _ including Ricardo Alarcon, Cuban National Assembly president _ that Castro ei41:wants to ei42:accompany the family were not yet ei43:approved, officials ei44:said.\nThe rush of events caps a four-month ei119:ordeal that has seen Elian ei143:catapulted into the center an international tug-of-war. He was ei45:found ei46:floating in an inner-tube off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day after a boat ei47:carrying him from Cuba ei48:sank. His mother and 10 other people ei144:drowned.\nFederal officials ei49:placed him with his Miami relatives, but ei50:kept custody over him. In January, Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner ei51:ruled that Elian should ei52:go back to Cuba, a ei125:decision ei53:upheld by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.\nThe Miami relatives ei54:filed a federal lawsuit to ei55:overturn the ei127:decision, but in March a Miami federal judge ei56:ruled against them. They immediately ei57:appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.\nLegal experts and federal officials ei58:maintain that Reno can ei59:allow the boy to be ei60:sent back to Cuba before the ei128:appeal is ei61:heard.\nLast week, federal officials ei62:sought to have the family must ei63:sign an agreement to ei64:turn the boy over voluntarily should they ei65:lose their ei130:appeal. If the family ei66:refused, INS had ei67:threatened to ei68:revoke Elian's parole, meaning federal officials would ei70:take him from the Miami family.\nThe family ei71:refused to ei72:sign the ei132:agreement through two days of negotiations, and INS ei73:extended its deadline until 9 a.m. EST Tuesday.\nThe terms of the ei134:talks ei74:changed dramatically, however, when Castro ei75:announced last Wednesday that the boy's father was ready to ei76:travel to the United States. Previously, Gonzalez had ei77:said he would never ei78:come here to ei79:get his son.\nOver the weekend, lawyers for the family ei80:raised accusations that Juan Miguel Gonzalez had ei81:mistreated his son in telephone ei136:conversations, ei82:saying he had ei83:told the boy that his mother was alive and ei84:waiting for him in Cuba.\nBut by Monday, federal officials hardened their ei137:negotiating stance, ei86:insisting the boy would be ei87:turned over to his father once the Cuban group ei88:arrives in the United States.\nMoves to ei89:keep Elian in this country through federal legislation ei90:appear to be ei91:stymied, as most lawmakers ei92:seem to ei93:agree the boy should ei94:go back to Cuba. A new ABC News-Washington Post opinion poll ei95:shows that 6 of 10 Americans also ei96:believe the boy should ei97:go home with his father.\nBut in Miami, Cuban exiles ei98:insist the majority of Americans don't ei100:understand the dynamics of life in Cuba. Just how far they are willing to ei101:go to ei102:prove their point remains to be ei146:seen.\n``If he ei103:goes back, he won't be with his real father,'' ei104:said Elias Hernandez, who ei105:joined the crowd outside the Little Havana home of Elian's Miami relatives. ``His father will be Fidel Castro, the worst dictator in history.''",

    "text": "The New York Times ei1:said in an editorial on Thursday, April 6:\nJuan Miguel Gonzalez has ei2:made the right ei54:decision to ei3:travel to the United States on Thursday to ei4:affirm his desire to be ei85:reunited with his son, Elian. His presence on American soil is necessary to ei86:dispel doubts about his fitness as a father _ ei5:raised maliciously by Elian's Miami relatives _ and to ei6:end ei57:speculation that he is indifferent about ei87:reclaiming custody of his son. With Gonzalez all but out of sight in Cuba, the relatives have had a free hand to ei7:distort the case with bogus legal arguments and unsubstantiated ei8:claims that Elian is afraid to ei9:see his father.\nThe relatives are obviously fond of Elian, though their judgment has clearly been ei88:clouded by their animosity toward Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader. Once Gonzalez ei10:comes to the United States _ it would be preferable if he ei11:went to Miami rather than to Washington _ only the most obdurate foes of Castro can ei12:argue that Elian should not be ei89:reunited with him. Gonzalez's ei62:arrival should also ei13:help ei14:clear the way for the Justice Department to ei15:make ei63:arrangements to ei16:transfer custody of the child.\nThe Miami relatives have ei17:left unclear whether they will willingly ei18:relinquish custody of Elian, and have done their best to ei19:stir passions against the Justice Department among Cuban-Americans in South Florida. In hopes of ei20:trumping the law, they have unreasonably ei21:demanded that a panel of child psychologists ei22:determine Elian's fate. The best ei68:outcome would be for the relatives to ei23:turn Elian over to his father as soon as Gonzalez ei24:arrives, and to ei25:do so in a spirit of kinship that ei26:makes the ei69:transition as smooth as possible for Elian. Once that ei27:happens, Gonzalez and Elian, though technically free to ei28:return to Cuba, should remain here to ei90:await an appellate court ei70:ruling on the case, which is ei30:expected next month.\nBut if the relatives ei31:balk, the Justice Department should quickly ei32:revoke their custody of the child and ei33:obtain a federal court ei72:order ei34:instructing them and their lawyers to ei35:turn Elian over to his father. The relatives may be less defiant if they are ei36:held in contempt of court.\nIf a court ei74:edict ei37:fails to ei91:compel ei75:compliance, the Justice Department will have to ei38:consider sterner measures, for the relatives will then be ei39:resisting the rule of law as ei40:defined by both the department and the courts. But Washington ought not to ei41:rush to ei42:take Elian forcibly from the relatives. That course would be psychologically wounding to the boy, and could ei44:lead to a violent ei78:confrontation with demonstrators who ei45:gather daily outside the relatives' home. The government ei79:yields none of its legal or moral authority in the case if it ei46:gives the relatives and their supporters time to ei47:reflect and to ei48:look for a gentler ei80:resolution.\nAs a matter of law, compassion and common sense, the government is entitled to ei92:reunite Elian with his father, and it has the power to ei49:enforce that right, despite the bluster of Miami's demagogic political leaders. But for now, everyone involved should be ei51:searching for an amicable ei82:ending. Juan Gonzalez is ei52:doing his part by ei53:making the short ei83:journey across the Florida Straits to ei93:erase any question about his love for his son.",

    "text": "MIAMI _\nThe small pharmacy on Unity Boulevard in Little Havana is unassuming. No Cuban flags sway from its door and no political signs ei2:pushing for the case of young Elian Gonzalez hang from its windows.\nBut the opinion of the woman who runs the modest business, which sells everything from prescription drugs to chewing gum and toys, carries a lot of weight in this part of Miami.\nShe is Fidel Castro's younger sister, Juanita. While her brother is the personification of evil in this neighborhood where Cuban flags fly from beatup Buicks, Juanita Castro is a beloved and respected member of this community.\nAnd while she maintains a distance between herself and the heated rhetoric and politics that ei69:envelop Miami, Friday she had definite opinions on the case of the 6-year-old Cuban boy that has ei10:dominated the city for almost five months now.\n``I feel for this child,'' Juanita Castro ei12:said. ``This has ei13:become too politicized, in both Cuba and Miami, and too many people are profiting from this ei70:tragedy. I ei14:think people have ei15:forgotten that this is a human issue.''\nJuanita Castro, who ei16:arrived in Miami in 1961, ei17:believes the custody of the child should be ei18:worked out between his family members. She is not certain whether the boy should ei19:stay in the United States, but she feels that since he's been here so long, he should be ei84:afforded the opportunity to ei21:live in a free country.\nWhen ei22:asked if she ei23:thought the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was being ei24:controlled by the Cuban government even though he has been in Bethesda, Md., for the last week, she ei86:frowned.\n``I don't ei26:know what Juan Miguel ei27:thinks or ei28:believes,'' Juanita Castro ei29:said. ``What I ei30:do ei31:think is that he should have ei32:arrived in this country at least 72 hours after his son was ei33:found ei34:floating off the coast of Fort Lauderdale.''\n``This has ei35:gone too far. And it's now ei36:become a ei73:tragedy.''\nDressed in a dark pink blazer and cream color pants, the sister of the Cuban dictator ei37:walked around the pharmacy ei38:talking warmly with her customers.\nShe ei39:said she she sometimes ei40:talks to family members back in Cuba. ``I have sisters that I still ei41:speak to,'' she ei42:said, ``and this ei76:situation is driving people crazy.''\nThe only thing on Cuban television is Elian's story, she ei44:said, and she feels the Cuban people are ei46:getting tired of the issue.\nShe does not ei47:speak to her brother and hasn't for several years. ``Nobody ei77:talks to Fidel, because he doesn't ei48:listen,'' Juanita Castro ei49:said. ``He ei50:talks and he ei85:decides.''\nJuanita Castro ei51:said she has not ei52:visited the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez and has no plans to ei53:do so. Although she ei54:supports the cause of Miami's Cubans in their struggle against her brother's government, she ei55:said she ei56:prefers to ei57:keep a low profile when it comes to politics.\n``I just ei59:work in my pharmacy every day and I ei60:pray for a ei82:resolution in our country (Cuba) that is without ei83:violence,'' she ei61:said. ``And I also ei87:pray for this young boy every day because he ei62:needs ei63:help. He's been through a lot.''",

    "text": "The Clinton administration's wisdom in ei1:returning Elian Gonzalez to his father was ei2:confirmed over the weekend decision of his Miami relatives and their Republican allies to further politicize what ought to be a straightforward child-custody case. Elian is finally ei4:getting time to ei63:reconnect with his father in a quiet, neutral setting where he is no longer a metaphor for the ei44:war between the Cubans.\nA few miles from his temporary home at Andrews Air Force Base, Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, both Republicans, and the relatives were ei5:treating the ei45:raid to ei6:return Elian as though it were a Nazi SS ei46:operation. Yet federal agents had a warrant, were ei7:enforcing US law, and ei8:entered the house with the proper force to ei9:ensure minimal ei47:resistance and ei48:injury. It was a model of efficient law enforcement, guided by due process.\nThe ei51:raid was necessary because the Gonzalez relatives in Miami, ei10:refusing to ei11:return the boy, made him into a symbol of resistance to Fidel Castro. Elian ei13:printed his name on an application for asylum and was ei14:put in front of a video camera to ei15:say that he did not ei16:want to ei17:go back to Cuba. The relatives ei18:treated the boy like a political prop.\nAs did Castro, a master manipulator of public opinion in Cuba. Had the relatives ei20:allowed Elian to ei21:return to Cuba, they would have ei22:denied the dictator an opportunity to ei64:reenergize support for his regime.\nJuan Miguel Gonzalez apparently is a Castro supporter, but that should not ei65:disqualify him from being ei66:reunited with his child. Ever since he first ei23:learned that Elian was in Florida last November, he has been persistent in ei24:seeking the boy's ei57:return.\nElian has ei25:developed great affection for the Miami relatives. It would be ideal if they could have ei26:returned him to his father yet ei27:stayed in contact while their ei60:appeal was pending in court. Negotiations ei28:failed, however, because they ei29:insisted on ei30:taking the place of the father, rather than being ei31:treated as concerned, yet distant, relatives.\nJuan and Elian Gonzalez will remain in the United States pending the ei61:appeal. The father can remain here, but he can also ei35:return to Cuba if he ei36:wishes. Like any other 6-year-old in the care of a loving parent, Elian should ei38:go wherever that parent ei39:wants.",

    "text": "(Undated)\nElian Gonzalez will remain in the United States for at least two more weeks even after a federal appeals court Thursday ei2:refused to ei3:order a political asylum ei127:hearing for the fought-over Cuban child.\nElian could be ei5:forced to ei6:stay longer if the Miami relatives who are ei7:seeking asylum for the child over his Cuban father's objections pursue further ei129:appeals. Attorney Kendall Coffey ei8:said his clients were ei9:giving an ei130:appeal to the Supreme Court ``serious consideration.''\nThe Miami relatives could also ei10:request a ei132:rehearing before the same three-judge panel that ei11:issued Thursday's ei133:ruling, or before the entire 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal. But Thursday's ei134:decision ei12:made it clear the family has only 14 days to decide whether to ei14:request a ei135:rehearing at that level. &UR;\n&LR; ``Expect no ei136:extensions,'' the court ei15:instructed.\nThe ei137:ruling ei211:follows six months of international family infighting, political recriminations and wide-spread ei140:protests in both Miami and Cuba over the fate of the 6-year-old boy.\nHis mother ei200:died ei17:trying to ei18:smuggle Elian out of Cuba, and it has been difficult for family members, Miami community leaders and many politicians to ei19:separate attitudes about Cuban leader Fidel Castro from the legal issues involved.\nThe appellate ei143:ruling ei21:made it clear the court ei23:takes no joy in ei24:lifting an obstacle to Elian's ei144:return to Cuba.\n``We ei25:acknowledge, as a widely accepted truth, that Cuba does ei27:violate human rights and fundamental freedoms and does not ei28:guarantee the rule of law to people living in Cuba,'' ei30:wrote Judge J.L. Edmonson, on behalf of the panel.\nBut the Immigration and Naturalization Service's ei148:decision to ei31:deny Elian an asylum ei149:hearing was ``within the outside border of reasonable choices,'' the opinion ei151:read. ``The court neither ei32:approves nor ei33:disapproves the INS' ei152:decision to ei34:reject the asylum applications ei35:filed on plaintiff's behalf, but the INS ei155:decision did not contradict (federal law.)''\nThe judges ei36:denied, however, a ei156:request by Elian's father to ei37:name him instead of great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez as Elian's representative in the ei38:continued court ei157:proceedings. Making Juan Miguel Gonzalez his son's legal representative would have ei39:allowed him to simply ei40:drop the asylum ei158:request and ei201:head for home.\nElian's great-uncle ei202:vowed to ei41:continue the ei159:battle, and ei42:said the Miami relatives might ei203:sue for visitation while the child is in the United States.\n``We will ei43:keep ei44:fighting with the laws ... so Elian Gonzalez can live in a free country like his mother ei46:wanted,'' Lazaro Gonzalez ei47:said.\nPresident Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno ei48:praised the ei162:ruling, with both ei49:stressing their confidence that Juan Miguel Gonzalez is the best person to ei50:raise his child. &UR;\n&LR; ``As I've ei51:said before, this is a case about the importance of family and the bond between a father and son,'' Clinton ei52:said in a ei53:written ei165:statement ei54:issued from Berlin.\nElian's father ei55:asked his Miami relatives to ei56:end their court ei166:battle after Thursday's ei167:ruling and ei57:allow him to finally ei204:return home with his son.\n``A child should simply be with his parents, always his parents,'' the elder Gonzalez ei58:said through an interpreter. Switching to English, he ei59:said, ``I ei60:want to ei61:thank the American people. Thank you.''\nElian was ei62:rescued off the coast of Florida by two American fishermen last November after the boat he was in ei63:capsized. Elian's mother and 10 others ei205:died, but the boy ei64:survived by ei65:clinging to an inner tube.\nElian's Miami relatives ei66:took in the child, but then ei67:refused to ei68:return him to his surviving father in Cuba, ei70:citing the harshness of the Castro regime.\nThe Miami relatives ei206:applied for political asylum on Elian's behalf, ei71:saying the child did not ei72:want to ei73:return to Cuba. INS agents ei74:traveled to Cuba to ei75:interview the child's father before the INS ei76:rejected the application for asylum, ei77:saying the child's father was the only person ei78:authorized to ei79:represent him. A district court judge ei80:upheld the federal agency.\nThe Miami relatives ei81:appealed that ei172:decision, and ei82:obtained an ei173:injunction requiring Elian to remain in the United States until the asylum question ei85:worked its way through the courts. Juan Miguel Gonzalez ei86:arrived in the United States April 2, and Reno ei87:ordered the Miami relatives to ei88:surrender the child to his father.\nThe family ei89:refused, and federal agents ei90:took the child by force in a pre-dawn ei175:raid on the Miami relatives' home on April 22.\nThe father and his son ei91:lived for a month on a large, private estate in Maryland, but have recently ei92:moved to an affluent neighborhood in Washington, D.C., to ei93:wait out the rest of their time in the United States.\nShortly after the appellate panel ei94:released its ei176:decision, attorney Coffey ei95:filed an emergency ei178:request to Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy (who has jurisdiction over such matters from Florida) ei96:requesting assurance that Elian will remain in the United States until the full Supreme Court can ei98:consider a formal ei181:appeal.\nBut Reno ei99:said the ei182:request to Kennedy ei100:serves no purpose since the ei183:injunction ei101:blocking Elian's ei184:return to Cuba still applies. If the family ei102:fails to ei103:file an ei185:appeal within 14 days, she ei104:said, the soonest Elian would be free to ei105:leave the country would be seven days later.\nHowever, Justice Department officials ei106:said the appellate court could ei207:decide to ei208:waive the extra seven-day period.\nProtesters were ei107:beginning to ei108:gather outside the Miami relatives' home even before the ei186:ruling was ei109:issued. They ei209:yelled and ei110:wept when the ei187:decision was ei111:announced.\nIn a ei188:statement ei189:read on Cuban television, Castro's government ei112:expressed its displeasure at still another ei190:delay in Elian's ei191:return. The government ei113:called the 14-day waiting period ``another ei192:concession to the `mafia' _ a disparaging term the government frequently ei116:uses to ei117:describe Miami's exile Cuban community.\nJose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, a Cuban exile group that frequently ei118:rescues Cuban refugees from the Straits of Florida, ei119:called the latest ei195:ruling ``outrageous.''\n``The saga of Elian Gonzalez is a ei120:turning point in relations in the Cuban community and the United States,'' Basulto ei121:said. ``This day, in the history of their relations with the United States, will be ei122:remembered in the Cuban community in the same way the Bay of Pigs is ei123:remembered.''\nCuban exiles ei124:failed to ei125:overthrow Castro in 1961 when the communist leader ei210:repelled their ei199:invasion at the Bay of Pigs.",
