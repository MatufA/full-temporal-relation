    "text": "On the other hand, it's ei375:turning out to be another very bad financial week for Asia. The financial ei377:assistance from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are not ei378:helping. In the last twenty four hours, the value of the Indonesian stock market has ei379:fallen by twelve percent. The Indonesian currency has ei380:lost twenty six percent of its value. In Singapore, stocks ei381:hit a five year low. In the Philippines, a four year low. And in Hong Kong, a three percent ei382:drop. More problems in Hong Kong for a place, for an economy, that many experts ei384:thought was once ei438:invincible. Here's ABC's Jim Laurie.\nNot that long ago, before the Chinese ei386:takeover, the news about real estate here was that the sky was the limit the highest prices in the world. So when Wong Kwan ei388:spent seventy million dollars for this house, he ei389:thought it was a great ei390:deal. He ei391:sold the property to five buyers and ei392:said he'd ei393:double his money.\nIn Hong Kong, is always belongs to the seller's market.\nNow with new ei395:construction under way, three of his buyers have ei397:backed out. And Wong Kwan will be lucky to ei398:break even. All across Hong Kong, the property market has ei399:crashed. Pamela Pak ei400:owns eight condominiums here. Pak can't ei401:find buyers. She ei402:estimates her properties, ei403:worth a hundred thirty million dollars in October, are ei404:worth only half that now.\nThey ei405:believe ah it will be always up ei406:going up and up ah forever. Nobody ei407:believe this any more.\nOf all of Asia's economies, Hong Kong is the most robust. But in the past three months, stocks have ei408:plunged, interest rates have ei409:soared and the ei410:downturn all across Asia means that people are not ei412:spending here.\nHotels are only thirty percent full. You can ei414:get seventy percent ei415:discounts at the shopping malls. Three thousand dollar pearls for eight hundred dollars. A two hundred dollar wool jacket for fifty dollars. Still, there are few buyers. And at the big brokerage houses, after ten years of ei417:boom, they're ei418:talking about ei419:layoffs.\nI ei420:think that the mood is fairly ei436:gloomy, and I ei422:think it's not going to ei424:change for a couple of years.\nSo for Hong Kong, it's time, as investment bankers like to say, to ei426:reposition. To either ei427:hold on tight or ei428:get out, as much of Asia ei429:goes into ei430:recession. Jim Laurie, ABC News, Hong Kong.",

    "text": "For his part, Fidel Castro is the ultimate political survivor. People have ei415:predicted his ei416:demise so many times, and the US has ei417:tried to ei418:hasten it on several occasions. Time and again, he ei419:endures. He has ei420:outlasted and sometimes ei421:outsmarted eight American presidents. Fidel Castro ei422:invited John Paul to ei423:come for a reason. This is clearly an opportunity for Cuba to look good internationally.\nThe entire world will ei424:see images of the Pope in Cuba. They'll ei425:see images of the Pope with Fidel Castro. It will ei426:give the rest of the world the view that Cuba is like any other nation, something the US has, of course, ei429:tried to ei430:persuade the world that it is not.\nFor nearly forty years, the United States has ei431:said categorically it would not ei432:tolerate totalitarian rule in its own backyard. It is the US economic and political ei434:embargo which has ei435:kept Cuba in a box.\nThe main positive for Castro to ei437:invite the Pope is international, to be ei438:able to ei439:say to the rest of the world, this government is not as closed, as intolerant, uh as totalitarian as some ei441:make it out to be.\nOne of the scenarios widely ei442:advanced before the ei443:visit is that through the Pope, Cuba, still ei444:led by Castro, can ei445:begin a more productive relationship with the world. That will, in turn, ei447:bring pressure on Washington to ei448:change.\nThose observers ei449:looking for a ei450:battle between uncompromising representatives and very different ideologies will, in all likelihood, be ei451:disappointed.\nCastro has said that you can be a Communist and still be a Christian. He ei452:says he and the Pope both ei453:want to ei454:end the ei455:exploitation of man by man. The question is who will Cubans ei456:believe?\nThe main negative is the risk that the Pope's ei458:visit will ei459:persuade a great many more Cubans to ei460:break loose of the Cuban government. If so, then the Pope's ei461:visit would really ei462:open up a new chapter in the government's relations with its own society. For the Cuban government, that is the risk.\nAt the end of the broadcast this evening, one more trip around Havana to see what it's been like since the last time.

Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Eileen Collins will be ei260:named ei261:commander of the Space Shuttle Columbia for a ei262:mission in December. Colonel Collins has been the ei263:co-pilot before, but this time she's the ei264:boss. Here's ABC's Ned Potter.\nEven two hundred miles up in space, there has been a glass ceiling. It wasn't until twenty years after the first astronauts were ei265:chosen that NASA finally ei266:included six women, and they were all scientists, not pilots.

It is, in short, the kind of management job many American women say they've had to fight for.

    "text": "Iraq's Saddam Hussein, ei1519:facing U.S. and Arab troops at the Saudi border, today ei1520:sought peace on another front by ei1522:promising to ei1523:withdraw from Iranian territory and ei1524:release soldiers ei1525:captured during the Iran-Iraq ei1526:war. Also today, King Hussein of Jordan ei1527:arrived in Washington ei1528:seeking to ei1529:mediate the Persian Gulf ei1530:crisis. President Bush on Tuesday ei1531:said the United States may ei1532:extend its naval quarantine to Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba to ei1534:shut off Iraq's last unhindered trade route. In another mediation effort, the Soviet Union ei1535:said today it had ei1536:sent an envoy to the Middle East on a series of ei1537:stops to include Baghdad. Soviet officials also ei1538:said Soviet women, children and invalids would be ei1539:allowed to ei1540:leave Iraq. President Bush today ei1541:denounced Saddam's ``ruinous policies of war,'' and ei1542:said the United States is ``ei1543:striking a blow for the principle that might does not make right.'' In a ei1544:speech ei1545:delivered at the Pentagon, Bush ei1546:seemed to ei1547:suggest that American forces could be in the gulf region for some time. ``No one should ei1549:doubt our staying power or determination,'' he ei1551:said.\nThe U.S. military ei1552:buildup in Saudi Arabia ei1553:continued at fever pace, with Syrian troops now part of a multinational force ei1555:camped out in the desert to ei1556:guard the Saudi kingdom from any new ei1557:thrust by Iraq. In a letter to President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran, ei1558:read by a broadcaster over Baghdad radio, Saddam ei1559:said he will ei1560:begin ei1561:withdrawing troops from Iranian territory on Friday and ei1562:release Iranian prisoners of war. Iran ei1563:said an Iraqi diplomatic delegation was en route to Tehran to ei1565:deliver Saddam's message, which it ei1566:said it would ei1567:review ``with optimism.'' Saddam ei1568:appeared to ei1569:accept a border demarcation treaty he had ei1571:rejected in peace ei1572:talks following the August 1988 ei1574:cease-fire of the eight-year ei1575:war with Iran. The move ei1576:seemed ei1577:aimed at ei1578:heading off more trouble with Iran, which had ei1580:condemned Iraq's ei1581:invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 but also ei1582:criticized the multinational force ei1583:dispatched to Saudi Arabia. Saddam ei1584:said he ei1585:sought to ``ei1586:turn the gulf into a lake of peace free of foreign fleets and forces that ei1589:harbor ill intentions against us.'' In other developments: The Pentagon ei1590:said that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is ei1591:considering ei1592:urging Bush to ei1593:order a national ei1594:callup of armed forces reserves for active duty because of the ei1596:drain on units ei1597:sending soldiers abroad. Bush can ei1598:call up to 200,000 reservists for up to 180 days without ei1599:seeking congressional approval. Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh ei1601:said special ambassador Mikhail Sytenko ei1602:left Tuesday for ei1603:consultations with the governments of Syria, Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries.\nSytenko, a former deputy secretary-general of the United Nations, is also ei1604:expected to ei1605:visit Baghdad, Gremitskikh ei1606:said at a regular news ei1607:briefing today. The outlook ei1608:darkened for about 3,000 Americans ei1609:caught in Iraq and Kuwait when Saddam ei1610:sent his forces into the small, oil-rich sultanate. The Iraqi ambassador to Greece ei1611:said in Athens the Americans and other stranded foreigners could ei1613:leave ``as soon as the threats from the United States and its allies are ei1615:eliminated.'' ABC ei1616:quoted an Iraqi Foreign Ministry official in Baghdad as ei1617:saying Americans in Iraq are ``restrictees'' who will ei1618:stay there until the ei1619:crisis ei1620:ends. The Soviet Foreign Ministry ei1621:said Soviet women, children and invalids would be ei1622:permitted to ei1623:leave Iraq. Spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh ei1624:said the first group of 230 evacuees was ei1625:assembling in Baghdad today, but evacuation plans were ei1628:hampered by desert heat and lack of transportation. Nearly 9,000 Soviets were among the hundreds of thousands of foreigners ei1629:trapped in Iraq and Kuwait. Iraq has ei1630:agreed to ei1631:allow all 880 Soviets in Kuwait to ei1632:leave, but only by a 1,200-mile road route through Iraq and to the Iraq-Jordan border. The British Foreign Office ei1633:said today conditions in Kuwait ei1634:appear to be ei1635:deteriorating. There have been reports of wholesale looting but food and gasoline were still available, ei1638:said a spokesman, who by custom was not ei1639:identified. Banks ei1640:remained ei1641:closed. The Iraqi ambassador to Venezuela ei1642:said on Tuesday that Iraq would ei1643:retaliate against Venezuela and other OPEC oil cartel members if they ei1644:boost oil production to ei1645:fill the gap ei1646:created by blocked supplies from Iraq and Kuwait. With Kuwait now ``ei1648:annexed,'' Iraq has control of 20 percent of the world's oil reserves. A steep ei1650:rise in world oil prices followed the Kuwait ei1651:invasion. The U.N. Security Council on Aug. 6 ei1652:ordered a global ei1653:embargo on trade with Iraq as punishment for ei1655:seizing Kuwait. Bush then ei1656:sent U.S. troops and planes to Saudi Arabia, ei1657:saying Iraqi troops ei1658:massed nearby in Kuwait ei1659:threatened Saudi Arabia and its vast oil reserves. Twelve Arab League nations ei1660:voted for an Arab force to ei1661:protect Saudi Arabia, with the vanguard of Syria's contingent ei1662:arriving Tuesday, ei1663:according to diplomatic sources in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Egyptian and Moroccan troops are already ei1664:there. The predominantly Moslem nation of Bangladesh ei1665:said today its troops would ei1666:join multinational forces in Saudi Arabia. The size of the contingent was not ei1667:disclosed. Turkey and Saudi Arabia in effect ei1668:shut down Iraq's major oil outlets through those countries, but ei1669:according to Jordanian officials, a smaller line into Jordan ei1670:remained ei1671:operating. Truckloads of goods ei1672:rolled into Iraq from Jordan on Tuesday and Iraqi-bound cargo was ei1673:unloaded from ships at the Red Sea port ofAqaba despite the U.N.-ordered ei1674:sanctions. King Hussein was reportedly ei1675:carrying a message to Bush from Iraq's Saddam, with whom the king ei1676:met Monday. The monarch will ei1677:meet Bush on Thursday in Kennebunkport, Maine. Crown Prince Hassan, King Hussein's brother and political adviser, was ei1678:asked today about the message the king was ei1679:said to be ei1680:carrying. In an ei1681:interview from Jordan on ABC, he ei1682:declined to ei1683:discuss details, but ei1684:said: ``I don't ei1685:think that his majesty would be ei1686:traveling at this crucial moment if the Iraqi leadership did not have a rational approach to the future.''\nA CBS News report ei1689:citing unidentified Jordanian sources ei1690:said that Saddam's message ei1691:called for an international conference to be ei1693:convened to ei1694:discuss an Iraqi ei1695:withdrawal from Kuwait. In exchange, the ei1697:buildup of U.S. forces in the region would ei1698:halt. Bush, however, ei1699:says he ei1700:sees no short-term hope for a diplomatic solution to the gulf ei1702:crisis _ at least until economic sanctions ei1703:force Saddam to ei1704:withdraw his army. Bush ei1705:held out the prospect of more aid to Jordan if it ei1707:cooperates with the trade embargo. On Tuesday, the United States and Soviet Union ei1709:conferred in Washington on ei1710:putting an anti-Iraq naval ei1711:blockade under a United Nations umbrella. The United States has ei1712:provided most of the naval vessels so far to block Iraqi trade, with Britain, West Germany and Australia among the other nations ei1713:lending support at sea. The ei1714:embargo is ei1715:meant to ei1716:cripple Iraq by ei1717:cutting off its exports of oil and imports of food and military supplies.\nIraq ei1718:imports about three-quarters of its foodstuffs. U.S. allies and other U.N. members have ei1719:objected that the Security Council embargo resolution did not specifically ei1721:authorize such a naval ei1722:operation. Bush ei1723:told a news conference on Tuesday that the naval barricade now in force might be ei1725:extended to Jordan's Aqaba ``if it is a hole through which commerce ei1726:flows'' in and out of Iraq. In Saudi Arabia, today is the eighth day of ``Desert Shield,'' the ei1728:operation designed to ei1730:confront an estimated 200,000 Iraqi soldiers now in Kuwait. Iraq ei1732:boasts an army of 1 million members. At least 50,000 U.S. troops are ei1733:expected to be ei1734:committed to Desert Shield within weeks, including Marines, Army air assault forces, paratroopers and infantry. Iraq ei1736:said it ei1737:invaded Kuwait because of ei1738:disputes over oil and money. It ei1739:accused Kuwait of deliberately ei1740:slashing Iraqi oil revenues by ei1741:overproducing oil and ei1742:driving down prices, among other charges. Iraq ei1743:has 17 million residents, and Kuwait about 1.9 million.",

    "text": "The Persian Gulf ei1522:showdown between Iraq and the United States ei1523:took a more personal turn Thursday when Iraq's Saddam Hussein ei1524:called President Bush a liar and ei1526:said the outbreak of holy ei1528:war could ei1529:bring thousands of Americans home in coffins. Bush, ei1531:commenting on the two-week gulf ei1532:crisis from his vacation home in Maine, ei1533:said he ei1534:saw little reason to be ei1536:optimistic about a ei1537:settlement of the ei1538:dispute, which ei1539:stems from Iraq's ei1540:invasion of oil-wealthy Kuwait and its subsequent military ei1541:buildup on the border of Saudi Arabia. After a two-hour ei1542:meeting at his Kennebunkport home with King Hussein of Jordan, Bush ei1543:said, ``I did not ei1544:come away with any feeling of hope'' that Iraq would ei1546:withdraw its army from Kuwait. Bush also ei1547:said Thursday that King Hussein ei1548:assured him Jordan would ei1549:close the last remaining free port to most Iraqi trade as the economic ei1550:embargo on materials to Iraq ei1551:continued unabated. Foodstuffs are among the goods being ei1553:blocked from entry; Iraq imports about three-quarters of its food. Pentagon sources in Washington meanwhile ei1555:said the Bush administration ei1556:plans to ei1557:deploy 45,000 Marines to the region to ei1558:back up the thousands of Army, Navy and Air Force troops already in place in the gulf and the Saudi desert. At a news ei1560:conference, Secretary of State James A. Baker III ei1561:said Jordan `` is ei1562:seeking some guidance'' about a provision in the U.N.-backed trade embargo that ei1566:allows food for humanitarian purposes. Worries however ei1567:grew about the safety of Americans and other Westerners ei1569:trapped in Kuwait. Iraqi military authorities ei1570:ordered all Americans and Britons in Kuwait to ei1571:assemble at a hotel, officials ei1572:said. ``Very few'' of the 2,500 Americans in occupied Kuwait ei1573:complied with the order, a senior U.S. official ei1574:told The Associated Press. Iraq ei1575:said the ei1576:roundup was to ei1577:protect them from unspecified ei1578:threats; British Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave ei1579:called the order ``grave and sinister.'' ``What we ei1581:fear is that they will be ei1582:interned somewhere, most likely in Iraq,'' Waldegrave ei1583:said. A total of about 3,000 Americans, 3,000 Britons and more than 450 Japanese are in Iraq and Kuwait. Overall, more than 2 million foreigners are in both countries. Iraq has called them ``restrictees.'' In addition to the estimated 45,000 Marines to ultimately be part of Operation Desert Shield, Stealth fighter planes and the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy are also ei1586:headed to Saudi Arabia to ei1587:protect it from Iraqi expansionism. In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams ei1589:said Iraq has ei1590:continued to ei1591:increase its armed forces in Kuwait and they now number about 160,000. Saddam has been under international quarantine since his Aug. 2 ei1594:power-grab, or what he ei1595:calls an ``eternal ei1742:merger'' with Kuwait. In a long verbal ei1597:attack read on Iraqi television Thursday, Saddam repeatedly ei1598:called Bush ``a liar'' and ei1600:said a shooting ei1601:war could ei1602:produce body bags courtesy of Baghdad. ``We ei1603:continue to ei1604:pray and ei1605:pray hard to God so that there will be no ei1606:confrontation whereby you will ei1607:receive thousands of Americans wrapped in sad coffins after you had ei1609:pushed them into a dark tunnel,'' Saddam ei1610:said. He ei1611:called U.S. soldiers ei1612:massing in Saudi Arabia the real occupiers in the Persian Gulf. ei1614:Replied State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher, ``We haven't really ei1615:analyzed the statement in detail but it ei1617:appears to be just another example of his outlandish rhetoric and his ei1618:attempts to ei1619:distort the truth. ``We ei1621:believe that his words cannot ei1622:distract the world from the facts of Iraqi aggression.'' An international land, sea and air force has ei1624:mobilized since Iraq's ei1625:invasion, which was ei1626:sparked by ei1627:disputes over oil, land and repayment of war loans. In the largest U.S. military ei1628:operation since Vietnam, an estimated 20,000 American GIs have already ei1630:massed to ei1631:defend Saudi Arabia. ``We don't just ei1632:arrive,'' ei1633:said four-star Gen. John Dailey, assistant commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. ``We're there to ei1635:stay for a fairly lengthy period.'' Egypt, Syria, Morocco and Bangladesh also ei1636:committed ground troops, to a much lesser degree. The U.S. Navy ei1637:has 27 ships in the maritime barricade of Iraq. They are ei1638:aided by Britain, West Germany, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium. Bush was ei1639:expected to ei1640:authorize naval commanders to ei1641:use ``the minimum force necessary'' to ei1642:interdict shipments to and from Iraq, a U.S. official ei1643:said. That could include ei1644:firing across the bow to ei1645:halt a ship. In the air, U.S. Air Force fliers ei1646:say they have ei1647:engaged in ``a little cat and mouse'' with Iraqi warplanes, which have ei1648:retreated when weapons radar ei1649:locks onto them. ``They don't ei1650:want to ei1651:play with us,'' one U.S. crew chief ei1652:said. In Kuwait, the Iraqis have ei1653:rimmed the capital city with an air-defense system, ei1654:according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He ei1655:declined to ei1656:say if the weapons ei1657:included missiles, but the Iraqis have them in their arsenal. The Iraqis also possess chemical weapons. The combined ei1658:operations are designed to ei1659:isolate and ei1660:strangle Iraq until it ei1661:retreats from Kuwait. The quarantine ei1663:hopes to ei1664:staunch the ei1665:flow of Iraqi oil, which is Iraq's economic lifeblood, and ei1666:clamp down on food and supplies ei1667:going in. Iraq now ei1668:controls 20 percent of the world's oil reserves with its ei1669:conquest of Kuwait. Only Saudi Arabia ei1670:has more oil reserves. The economic ei1671:chokehold appears to be working. The Lloyd's List International newspaper, which monitors worldwide shipping, ei1672:said Iraq's fleet of 80 tankers and cargo ships has ei1673:stopped regular ei1674:trading. John Prescott, a shipping correspondent, ei1675:said there was no ei1676:shipping in Kuwaiti or Iraqi ports and that activity was ei1677:trailing off in the Jordanian port of Aqaba. Bush's chief objective in his ei1679:meeting with Hussein was to ei1680:press the king to ei1681:shut down Iraq's food and oil supply route from Aqaba on the Red Sea. Aqaba is Iraq's only ei1682:outlet now that an international noose has ei1683:tightened. Bush has ei1684:indicated the U.S. Navy will ei1685:barricade the port from Iraqi ships. The president also has ei1686:offered to ei1687:help ei1688:offset Jordan's costs because 40 percent of its exports ei1690:go to Iraq and 90 percent of its oil ei1692:comes from there. ``It's our only outlet to the sea and the rest of the world,'' Hussein ei1694:said. He also ei1695:said of trade with Iraq: ``There are no shipments at the moment.'' A day earlier, scores of trucks, many with Iraqi license plates, ei1697:streamed north out of Aqaba to Amman and onto the desert highway bound for Iraq. The Jordanian monarch ei1698:met this week with Saddam, but he ei1699:told reporters he had no message from Baghdad. ``I am not ei1701:talking on behalf of anyone in the area... but myself,'' Hussein ei1703:said. In the United Nations, Libya ei1704:called for the ei1705:replacement of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf with Arab League forces and U.N. soldiers. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, in a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General, also ei1706:called for an emergency Security Council ei1707:meeting in Geneva to ei1708:remove U.S. forces. There was no ei1709:decision on a ei1710:meeting. Thirty-two of the 159 U.N. members had ei1711:filed compliance reports by Wednesday, and all were ei1712:honoring the sanctions Iraq. Also Thursday, Saudi Arabia ei1714:called for an emergency ei1715:conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to ei1716:discuss how much oil to ei1717:pump. The minister ei1718:denied the kingdom had e3000:notified notified any of its customers of any ei1720:cutbacks in oil supply. Reports attributed to the Japanese foreign ministry ei1721:said Saudi Arabia ei1722:told U.S., European and Japanese oil companies of a 15-20 percent ei1723:cutback in its oil supply in September. Meanwhile, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency ei1724:said Thursday that Saddam was the ei1725:target of an assassination ei1727:attempt, which ei1728:led to ``large-scale'' ei1729:arrests, including some close associates of the Iraqi strongman. The agency ei1730:quoted witnesses as ei1731:saying tanks and armored cars are ei1732:patrolling the streets of Baghdad. There was no independent ei1733:confirmation of the report by the government-run news agency, which did not ei1736:say when the reported ei1737:attempt ei1738:occurred.",

    "text": "CANBERRA, Australia (AP)_ ei2000:Turning its back on 210 years of loyalty to the British royal family, a constitutional convention ei2001:voted overwhelmingly Friday to ei2002:make Australia a republic under its own president. Prime Minister John Howard, a monarchist himself, ei2003:promised to ei2004:put the question to a national ei2006:referendum next year after convention delegates ei2007:voted 89-52 for a republic, with 11 abstentions. Spontaneous ei2008:applause ei2009:echoed through the chamber and public galleries as the crucial ei2010:vote ei2011:passed by a wide margin. ``I ei2012:want a ei2013:referendum,'' Howard ei2014:said. ``The Australian people are ei2015:owed the opportunity of ei2016:expressing an opinion on this.'' ``It would be a ei2017:travesty in common sense terms of Australian democracy for that proposition not to be ei2019:put to the Australian people,'' Howard ei2020:said. Even in his own Cabinet, Howard is ei2021:becoming increasingly ei2022:isolated with his monarchist stance. Treasurer Peter Costello, Environment Minister Robert Hill and Attorney General Daryl Williams all ei2023:voted to ei2024:support the republic Friday. ``This convention will be ei2025:seen as a turning point in our history,'' Australian Republican Movement spokeswoman Mary Delahunty ei2026:said. Pro-republicans ei2027:hope to ei2028:have an Australian president by the ei2029:opening of the 2000 Olympics and the 100th anniversary of Australian federation. ei2030:Calling for an amended constitution with a new preamble, to be ei2032:written by Australian poets, republican Janet Holmes a Court ei2033:said, ``We ei2034:need the smell of eucalyptus in this, and the feel of red dust.'' Monarchists ei2035:hope to ei2036:defeat the republic at the ei2037:referendum. ``The phony ei2038:war has ei2039:finished and the real referendum ei2040:campaign has clearly ei2041:begun,'' Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy executive director Kerry Jones ei2042:said. ``Well may we ei2043:say `God e3000:save the Queen,' for nothing will save the republic,'' outraged monarchist delegate David Mitchell ei2046:said. ``The idea of a republic will ei2047:fall to dust through the grace of almighty God.'' Polls have ei2049:shown public support for a republic ei2051:increasing, ei2052:rising from about 35 percent several years ago to about 51 percent this year, as pro-monarchist sentiment ei2055:diminishes. Australia has been ei2056:independent since 1901, but like many Commonwealth nations it still ei2057:recognizes the British monarch as its head of state. Howard ei2058:said Queen Elizabeth II is ei2059:taking a great interest in the ei2060:convention. ``She is, I can ei2061:assure you, from what I've been ei2062:told, she's ei2063:following the thing very closely and ei2065:taking the view it's our business. ``It's no secret that she's ei2067:indicated to me... she is a 20th century democrat, ei2069:understands that the role of the crown in Australia ei2070:rests in the hands of the Australian people as it ei2071:has for almost a hundred years.'' The model for a republic, ei2072:adopted over bitter ei2073:objections from those ei2074:advocating direct election of a president, is for presidential nominations to be made with public input and the winning candidate decided by a two-thirds majority of Parliament. Former prime minister Paul Keating, who ei2076:put the republic issue in the spotlight in his unsuccessful 1996 ei2077:campaign for re-election, ei2078:welcomed the ei2079:result. ``This is an important step along the path towards Australia claiming its full sovereignty, and due recognition that the monarchy can no longer serve us appropriately,'' Keating said.",

    "text": "O'SMACH, Cambodia (AP)_ The top commander of a Cambodian resistance force ei2455:said Thursday he has ei2456:sent a team to ei2457:recover the remains of a British mine removal expert ei2458:kidnapped and ei2459:presumed ei2460:killed by Khmer Rouge guerrillas almost two years ago. Gen. Nhek Bunchhay, a loyalist of ousted Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, ei2461:said in an ei2462:interview with The Associated Press at his hilltop headquarters that he ei2463:hopes to ei2464:recover the remains of Christopher Howes within the next two weeks. Howes had been ei2465:working for the Britain-based Mines Advisory Group when he was ei2466:abducted with his Cambodian interpreter Houn Hourth in March 1996. There were many conflicting accounts of his ei2468:fate. Howes' team was ei2469:clearing mines 17 kilometers (10 miles) from Angkor Wat, the fabled 11th century temple that is Cambodia's main tourist attraction, when it was ei2470:attacked. In January this year, British police officers who had been ei2471:searching for Howes ei2472:concluded he had probably been ei2473:killed soon after being ei2474:captured. The Foreign Office ei2475:said it had ei2476:informed the family of Howes, 37 years old when he was ei2477:kidnapped, that he probably ei2478:died within weeks or months of his ei2479:capture on March 26, 1996. ``Obviously, it is deeply ei2480:discouraging for the family after 22 months, but there is no proof of life. But there is no evidence in either direction _ that there is proof of life or death,'' ei2487:said a Foreign Office spokesman, ei2488:speaking with customary anonymity. ``We will ei2489:continue to ei2490:do everything we can to ei2491:establish what has ei2492:happened.'' Thai military officials who monitor Cambodian affairs ei2493:said privately Thursday that Britain, through its embassies in Thailand and Cambodia, has been ei2494:pushing hard to ei2495:resolve the Howes case as the second ei2543:anniversary of his ei2497:abduction nears. Nhek Bunchhay, who had been closely ei2498:involved in the ei2499:search for Howes before having to ei2500:flee the Cambodian capital after a ei2501:coup d'etat last year, ei2502:appeared confident he would ei2503:find Howes' remains. He ei2504:said he ei2505:received information from Khmer Rouge guerrillas on where the body had been ei2506:buried, and recently ei2507:ordered 10 of his men from a force of 500 near Khmer Rouge headquarters in Anlong Veng to ei2508:conduct the ei2509:search. If and when the remains are ei2510:found, he ei2511:said, they would be ei2512:turned over to the British Embassy, apparently meaning they would be ei2513:sent across the border into Thailand and onward to Bangkok. Nhek Bunchhay ei2514:said he now ei2515:believed Howes had been ei2516:killed within a week of his ei2517:capture by a Khmer Rouge faction loyal to Pol Pot, then the guerrilla group's leader. Pol Pot is ei2518:considered ei2519:responsible for the radical ei2520:policies that ei2521:led to the ei2522:deaths of as many as 1.7 million Cambodians when the communist group ei2523:held power in the late 1970s. At the time Howes was ei2524:captured, the Khmer Rouge were a more or less united guerrilla force with more than 10,000 men under arms. But the group ei2525:began to ei2526:fall apart in mid-1996 after the ei2527:defection of one of its top leaders, Ieng Sary. Other commanders, and thousands of guerrillas, ei2528:followed him. A small hardcore group under Pol Pot ei2529:continued to ei2530:hold out at their headquarters at Anlong Veng in northern Cambodia near the Thai border. But in June last year, the remaining leadership had a ei2531:falling out, and Pol Pot was ei2532:arrested. In July last year in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen ei2533:staged a successful ei2544:coup d'etat against First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Ranariddh's loyalists, including Nhek Bunchhay, his top military commander, ei2535:went into hiding or ei2536:fled the capital. Nhek Bunchhay, ei2537:evading an intensive ei2538:manhunt, ei2539:made his way to O'Smach, the last major outpost held by Ranariddh's forces. His men have held the stronghold _ which is on the border just opposite the Thai province of Surin _ against repeated intense ei2540:attacks by Hun Sen's troops. They have been ei2541:aided by Khmer Rouge guerrillas from Anlong Veng, who have ei2542:formed an alliance with Ranariddh's resistance forces to oppose Hun Sen.",

    "text": "JERUSALEM (AP)_ ei388:Taking the stand in her own defense, a friend of Yitzhak Rabin's assassin ei389:said Friday that she ei390:regretted ei391:calling the prime minister a traitor and ei393:praying for his ei394:death. Margalit Har-Shefi, 22, has ei395:pleaded innocent to ei397:charges that she ei398:failed to ei399:report Yigal Amir's ei400:plan to ei401:kill Rabin. She ei402:took the stand for more than four hours Friday in a Tel Aviv magistrate's court. Amir, 27, is ei403:serving a life sentence for the November 1995 ei404:assassination of Rabin at a Tel Aviv peace ei405:rally. Newspaper reports have ei406:said Amir was ei407:infatuated with Har-Shefi and may have been ei408:trying to ei409:impress her by ei410:killing the prime minister. Har-Shefi ei411:acknowledged she ei412:told police interrogators that Rabin was a ei413:traitor and that she ei414:prayed for him to have a heart attack and ei416:die. She ei417:said Rabin's ei418:murder was ``a black stain on Israel,'' Israel radio and Israel army radio ei419:reported. Har-Shefi ei420:said she ei421:heard Amir ei422:talk about ei423:killing Rabin but did not ei424:tell the police because she did not ei425:believe he was ei426:serious. Instead, she ei427:turned to her community rabbi in the Jewish West Bank settlement of Beit El and ei428:told him about Amir's statements. The rabbi ei430:said ei431:called the ei432:talk about ei433:killing Rabin ``nonsense,'' and ei435:said Jews are ei436:prohibited from killing one another, the radio reports ei437:said. Har-Shefi ei438:described Amir as an ``original thinker,'' as well as delusional and a liar. She also ei439:denied ei440:accusations ei441:made by Amir's brother, Hagai, that she ei442:joined an anti-Arab underground movement. She ei443:said she ei444:gave the Amir brothers false information regarding the location of a weapons and ammunition cache when they ei445:asked her to ei446:help ei447:organize such a movement.",

    "text": "MOSCOW (AP)_ Presidents Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia ei2306:signed an economic cooperation plan Friday, and Yeltsin ei2307:claimed they ei2308:resolved even more nagging problems. Russia and Ukraine share similar cultures and languages, and Ukraine was ei2309:ruled from Moscow for centuries. But while the two Slavic neighbors see themselves as natural partners, their relations since the ei2310:breakup of the Soviet Union have been ei2311:bedeviled by a number of ei2312:disputes _ Black Sea naval bases, border problems and Ukraine's natural gas debts. ``We have ei2313:covered the entire list of questions and ei2314:discussed how we will be ei2315:tackling them,'' Yeltsin was ei2316:quoted as ei2317:saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``I must ei2318:say there are no unsettled problems any more. We have ei2319:solved them all.'' But his sweeping statement contained no details, and gave no indication of how the ei2320:disputes could be ei2321:resolved. Their solution would ei2322:require a ei2323:compromise between the two nations' parliaments. A major ei2324:dispute concerns a broad political treaty calling for border demarcation, which the two presidents ei2325:signed last May. In effect, the treaty amounts to Russian recognition of Ukraine's sovereignty and borders, and the Ukrainian parliament has already ei2326:ratified it. However, Russia has ei2327:stalled ei2328:ratification, ei2329:trying to ei2330:tie it to an agreement that would ei2332:permit the Russian navy to ei2333:use a naval base on Ukraine's Crimean peninsula for at least 20 more years. In their joint statement ei2334:issued after the ei2335:talks, Yeltsin and Kuchma ei2336:called for the fastest possible ei2337:ratification of the treaty, ei2338:saying it would ei2339:create a ``strong legal foundation'' for bilateral ties and ei2340:help stability in Europe. Kuchma ei2341:assured Yeltsin that Ukraine would not ei2342:join NATO, Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky ei2343:said, ei2344:according to the Interfax news agency. The Russian leadership has staunchly ei2345:opposed the western alliance's ei2346:expansion into Eastern Europe. In their joint statement, ei2347:released by the Kremlin, the two leaders also ei2348:pledged to ei2349:consult each other regularly on their approaches to relations with NATO and, in particular, their action within the framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Last year, Russian officials ei2350:assailed Ukraine for ei2351:holding joint naval ei2352:exercises with NATO in the Black Sea _ an area Moscow considers its own turf. Kuchma has ei2353:said repeatedly that Ukraine would ei2354:remain neutral for the foreseeable future. Yeltsin and Kuchma also ei2355:called for ei2356:developing the stagnant relations between the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose coalition of former Soviet republics. In the past, Russia has often ei2357:claimed that Ukraine was ei2358:undermining efforts at closer cooperation within the CIS. A major goal of Kuchma's four-day state ei2359:visit was the ei2360:signing of a 10-year economic program ei2361:aimed at ei2362:doubling the two nations' trade turnover, which ei2363:fell to dlrs 14 billion last year, down dlrs 2.5 billion from 1996. The two presidents on Friday ei2364:signed the plan, which ei2365:calls for ei2366:cooperation in the metallurgy, fuel, energy, aircraft building, missile, space and chemical industries. A major project is joint ei2367:manufacturing of An-70 cargo planes, the Kremlin statement ei2368:said. The program also ei2369:calls for ei2370:coordination of economic reforms and joint ei2371:improvement of social programs in the two countries, where many people have become ei2372:impoverished during the chaotic post-Soviet ei2373:transition to capitalism. Kuchma also ei2374:planned to ei2375:visit Russian gas giant Gazprom, most likely to ei2376:discuss Ukraine's dlrs 1.2 billion debt to the company. (pvs/vi/ji)",

    "text": "JERUSALEM (AP)_ Top Israeli officials ei1998:sent strong new signals Sunday that Israel ei2000:wants to ei2001:withdraw from southern Lebanon, where a costly ei2002:war of attrition has been steadily ei2003:claiming soldiers' lives. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ei2004:told his Cabinet on Sunday that Israel was ei2005:willing to ei2006:withdraw from southern Lebanon provided Israel's northern frontier could be ei2007:secured. ``If the Lebanese government will ei2008:cooperate with us in ei2009:making appropriate security arrangements in south Lebanon, we will be happy to ei2010:get out of Lebanon in the framework of implementation of U.N. Resolution 425,'' Netanyahu ei2011:told his ministers. That 1978 resolution ei2013:calls for Israel's unconditional ei2014:withdrawal from the self-declared security zone it ei2015:occupies in south Lebanon, and for the ei2016:deployment of the Lebanese army and U.N. forces to ei2017:ensure security along the Lebanese-Israeli border. On Friday, Netanyahu ei2018:said he ei2019:had ``no qualms'' about ei2020:implementing the U.N. resolution, as long as Israel ei2021:had ``the necessary security safeguards.'' Cabinet minister Michael Eitan ei2022:said Sunday that Netanyahu's ei2023:remarks ei2024:marked a substantive ei2025:change in Israel's position. ``We will ei2026:defend our north from the international border,'' ei2027:said Eitan, the science minister. ``No one ei2028:wants to ei2029:stay in Lebanon; thus we ei2030:think it better to ei2032:withdraw.'' Uri Lubrani, Israel's top official for Lebanon affairs, also ei2033:suggested Israel was ei2034:willing to ei2035:modify its political goals in Lebanon. ``This is a new thing...it means that we are ei2036:willing to ei2037:talk today _ full stop _ about security,'' Lubrani ei2038:told Israel's Channel One. ``We have ei2039:gotten off the issue of peace, off the issue of normalization.'' As the death toll in Lebanon has ei2040:mounted, the Israeli government has been ei2041:faced with a growing grassroots ei2042:movement ei2043:calling for Israel's unilateral ei2044:withdrawal from Lebanon. Since 1985 _ when the Israelis ei2045:created a security buffer zone southern Lebanon _ nearly 200 Israeli soldiers have been ei2046:killed ei2047:fighting Hezbollah and other guerrillas. Last week, Hezbollah fighters ei2048:killed three Israeli soldiers and seriously ei2049:wounded six others. The Israelis ei2050:suffered a record 39 deaths in southern Lebanon last year. In addition, 73 soldiers were ei2052:killed en route to Lebanon when two military helicopters ei2053:crashed last February. The Maariv newspaper ei2054:said Sunday that Netanyahu's comments last week were in response to signals from Syria that it ei2057:wants to ei2058:renew the long-stalled peace ei2059:talks between the two countries. The newspaper, ei2060:quoting ``secret reports,'' ei2062:said Syria had ei2063:indicated its interest in ei2064:resuming ei2065:talks in ei2066:remarks ei2067:made last week by the Syrian ambassador to Washington, Walid Mualem, in a ei2068:lecture to a closed forum in Baltimore. Two top aides to Netanyahu, political adviser Uzi Arad and Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, ei2069:left for Europe on Sunday, apparently to ei2070:investigate the Syrian issue, the newspaper ei2071:said. Israel-Syrian ei2072:talks have been ei2073:cut off for nearly two years. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai was the first senior Israeli official to ei2074:refer to U.N. resolution 425 in a ei2075:speech six weeks ago, ei2076:saying at the time he was ei2077:willing to ei2078:withdraw troops in exchange for guarantees that Israel would not be ei2081:attacked.",

    "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)_ An American leader of a U.N. weapons inspection team ei1233:resumed ei1234:work in Iraq Friday, nearly two months after his team was effectively ei1235:blocked. Scott Ritter ei1236:led his team on a 10-hour ei1237:tour of three suspected weapons sites classified as ``sensitive'' by the Iraqi authorities, U.N. spokesman Alan Dacey ei1238:said. ``All sites were ei1239:inspected to the satisfaction of the inspection team and with full cooperation of Iraqi authorities,'' Dacey ei1241:said. At least one of the sensitive sites was a barracks of the elite Republican Guard, a well-placed source told The Associated Press. Previously the Iraqis have ei1242:resisted ei1243:attempts to ei1244:inspect such quarters. The U.N. Security Council has ei1245:charged the inspectors with ei1246:verifying that Iraq has ei1247:destroyed its long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction. It was the first time that Ritter, who ei1248:arrived Thursday with some 50 inspectors for a ei1249:tour likely to ei1250:last over a week, had been ei1251:allowed to ei1252:carry out an ei1253:inspection since Jan. 13. Then the Baghdad government ei1254:stopped ei1255:providing Ritter's team with escorts, ei1256:making it impossible for him to ei1257:enter any site. Iraq ei1258:alleged Ritter was an American spy whose team had a disproportionately high number of Americans and Britons. The official Iraqi News Agency, which gives the daily tally of inspections, did not ei1259:mention Ritter by name, but ei1260:said Friday that team no. 225 _ which Ritter heads _ ei1261:made surprise ei1262:visits to a number of sites and was ei1263:assisted by aerial surveillance. Five other U.N. inspection teams ei1264:visited a total of nine other sites, the agency ei1265:reported. An Iraqi official, ei1266:speaking on customary condition of anonymity, ei1267:said Ritter would not ei1268:try to ei1269:visit any of the eight presidential sites that Baghdad had ei1270:placed off-limits to U.N. weapons inspectors. The official ei1271:said these sites could only be ei1272:visited by a special team of U.N. monitors and diplomats as ei1273:laid down by the Feb. 23 accord ei1274:signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Ritter's ei1275:return is ei1276:seen as something of a ei1277:test of that agreement, under which Iraq ei1278:agreed to ei1279:give inspectors full access to eight of Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces. The United States had ei1280:moved additional troops and a naval armada into the Gulf and ei1281:said it would ei1282:strike Iraq unless it gave the U.N. arms inspectors unfettered access to all potential weapons sites, including Saddam's palaces. Iraq had ei1283:argued the presidential sites should be off limits as symbols of sovereignty. A Pentagon spokesman ei1285:said Thursday that the 38,000 U.S. troops in the Gulf will ei1286:remain until Iraq ei1287:complies with the U.N. Security Council agreement over weapons inspections. ``We are going to ei1288:maintain our forces in the region for the foreseeable future,'' ei1289:said spokesman Kenneth Bacon. The U.N.-Iraq accord was ei1290:worked out by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who ei1291:appointed a retired Indian diplomat on Thursday as his special representative to Iraq. Prakash Shah, 58, a former Indian ambassador to the United Nations, is part of an ei1292:effort by Annan to ei1293:expand contacts with the Iraqi leadership. Palace ei1294:inspections are not ei1295:expected to ei1296:start until the new agreement's procedures are in place. U.N. officials in New York on Friday ei1298:finished ei1299:drafting the rules, in consultation with Iraqi diplomats. The procedures are due to ei1301:go before the Security Council next week. The Security Council has ei1302:said it will not ei1303:lift the sweeping sanctions ei1304:imposed on Iraq after its 1990 ei1305:invasion of Kuwait until the U.N. inspectors ei1306:certify that Baghdad has ei1307:eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.",

    "text": "BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP)_ Police ei2026:seized a car bomb under construction Sunday in a town bordering Northern Ireland on the eve of the ei2027:return to peace ei2028:talks by the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party. Chief Superintendent Al McHugh ei2029:said the bomb ei2031:discovered in the Irish Republic was destined for an unknown target in Northern Ireland and ``would have ei2032:caused massive ei2033:destruction.'' The ei2034:discovery ei2035:appeared to be the latest ei2036:attempt by extremists opposed to the IRA's 8-month-old ei2037:truce to ei2038:undermine the peace process, ei2039:set to ei2040:resume Monday in Belfast. Extremists have ei2041:bombed two predominantly pro-British Protestant towns and fired mortar shells at a police station since Sinn Fein was ei2042:expelled from peace talks on Feb. 20 in ei2043:punishment for two ei2044:killings blamed on the Irish Republican Army. Police ei2045:found more than 1,300 pounds (600 kgs) of fertilizer-based explosives Sunday in a shed in Dundalk, 50 miles (80 kms) south of Belfast. They ei2046:arrested two men in connection with the bomb factory, which also contained circuitry, detonating cord and the Mitsubishi truck that would have ei2047:carried the bomb. The British and Irish governments, which ei2048:cosponsor the multi-party talks that are ei2049:supposed to ei2050:conclude by May, ei2051:invited Sinn Fein to ei2052:rejoin two weeks ago. But Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams ei2053:kept his party out pending ei2054:meetings with British Prime Minister Tony Blair 10 days ago and President Clinton last week. ``We were unjustly ei2055:pushed out of the ei2056:talks in February but we are back,'' Adams ei2057:said Sunday. He ei2058:said the north's substantial Catholic minority ei2059:demanded a settlement that would ei2061:promote Northern Ireland's eventual ei2062:unification with the Irish Republic. ``Nationalists in the north are not a minority in someone else's country. We are Irish citizens, ei2063:living in our own country,'' Adams ei2064:said, ei2065:adding: ``Nationalists ei2066:want to ei2067:move towards Irish unity and see this process as a bridge in that direction.'' But the north's pro-British Protestant majority is bitterly ei2068:opposed to ei2069:uniting Ireland and instead ei2070:wants a strong government for Northern Ireland, which has been ei2072:ruled directly by London since 1972. Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, is ei2073:threatening to ei2074:push for Sinn Fein's ei2075:expulsion once again. They ei2076:say IRA commanders are ei2077:responsible for the recent bomb ei2078:attacks. Also Sunday, more than 2,000 Catholic protesters ei2079:rallied in Portadown against the annual parades by the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's dominant Protestant fraternal group. ei2080:Confrontations among Catholic protesters, Protestant marchers and the police have ei2081:provoked widespread ei2082:violence in Northern Ireland for the past three summers. The crucible is Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms) southwest of Belfast, where Orangemen march each July from their rural church back downtown _ through the town's main Catholic area. Protesters from several Catholic communities ei2083:crowded into Portadown's Catholic Garvaghy Road to ei2084:hear speakers ei2085:demand ei2086:negotiations with Orange Order leaders, and ei2087:pledge to ei2088:participate in each others' road-blocking ei2089:protests this summer. ``Small nationalist communities are not going to be ei2090:left on their own this summer,'' ei2091:said Gerard Rice, a former IRA prisoner who leads anti-Orange protests in a Catholic neighborhood of south Belfast. Riot police in armored cars, shields and helmets ei2092:prevented a few hundred Protestants, many ei2093:waving British and Ulster flags, from ei2094:interfering with the Catholics as they ei2095:marched within Portadown's few Catholic streets. Earlier Sunday, police and militant Protestants ei2096:clashed in a religiously polarized part of north Belfast. Police ei2097:said an unmarked police car was ei2098:hit with gasoline bombs from the Protestant side. Riot police ei2099:responded with a volley of plastic bullets that ei2100:scattered a 50-strong mob. An elderly Catholic man was ei2101:hospitalized from cuts after a Protestant gasoline bomb ei2103:landed in his back yard. Police ei2104:arrested six Protestants on suspicion of rioting. (sp/eml)",

With the ei245:convergence of communications and information technologies (IT) coupled with the ei246:coming of age for the Internet and its related technologies, the stage is ei247:set for Malaysians to ei248:seize the chance to ei249:transform into a knowledge society and ei250:become worthy opponents/players in the global market space. The Internet, the global network of computers, is now far ei252:reaching into the country - ei253:extending its embrace to ei254:include every nook and cranny of the nation - ei255:opening doors to not only a diverse range of information sources but also an exhaustive list of possibilities to ei256:create new applications which ei257:add value to people's lives. In the business world, the Internet - through intranet and extranet solutions - has ei258:become an invaluable tool for companies to harness so as to ei260:gain a competitive edge. The solutions are also vital components in ei261:developing the borderless marketing flagship application which is a vital element for ei262:spearheading the ei263:development of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project. The application will ei264:create the necessary framework and infrastructure to ei265:support electronic commerce (e-commerce) ei266:initiatives in the country. However, it is important to note that ei267:installing or ei268:implementing Internet technologies for technology's sake would not ei269:ensure instant ei270:success. For e-commerce to ei271:flourish with full-blown end-to-end business ei272:transactions, strategic ei273:planning which incorporates both business and technology plans that are complementary is necessary for an organisation to ei275:see feasible returns on investment. Intranets, through the use of Internet technology, are ei276:positioned as a platform for companies to ei277:optimise, ei278:expand and ei279:transform new channels of business. When strategically ei280:implemented, an intranet solution will ei281:provide the ability to ei282:mediate mission-critical, decision support functions in organisations. It will also ei283:help further ei284:improve communications and collaboration at all levels in an organisation. With intranets in place, it is only logical for organisations to respectively ei288:link the network to other companies' for extended business purposes through extranets. While this will ei289:enable the sharing of information among enterprises, security issues such as firewalls and encryption as well as access and control procedures, and the trust levels that enterprises have with each other will ei290:emerge and there will be a need to ei292:address them. Other than ei293:usage in business, Internet technology is also ei294:beginning to ei295:infiltrate the lifestyle domain. ``Smart homes'' have ei296:emerged ei297:bringing a wealth of information and entertainment to families over telecommunications lines. The art of socialising is also ei298:experiencing a ei299:change where Net/virtual relationships are fast ei300:overtaking or ei301:becoming parallel with the normal human relationships.

    "text": "WASHINGTON _ The economy ei2184:created jobs at a surprisingly robust pace in January, the government ei2185:reported on Friday, evidence that America's economic stamina has ei2186:withstood any ei2187:disruptions ei2188:caused so far by the financial ei2189:tumult in Asia. The Bureau of Labor Statistics ei2190:said the economy ei2191:added 358,000 jobs last month, far above the 235,000 ei2192:forecast by economists. It was the third consecutive month that job generation has been exceptionally strong. With growing opportunities for work ei2193:drawing more people into the labor force, the unemployment rate ei2194:remained at 4.7 percent last month, just a notch above its quarter-century low. The ei2195:demand for workers also ei2196:led employers to ei2197:raise wages again last month. Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees ei2198:rose 4 cents, to $12.51. The gain ei2199:left wages 3.8 percent higher than a year earlier, ei2200:extending a ei2201:trend that has ei2202:given back to workers some of the earning power they ei2203:lost to inflation in the last decade. But economists ei2204:said the wage ei2205:increase was not enough to ei2206:raise any concerns about higher inflation. And because the Federal Reserve has ei2207:made clear that it ei2208:expects the economy to ei2209:slow in coming months as ripple effects from Asia ei2210:reach the United States, investors ei2211:disregarded the large jobs gains, ei2212:betting that neither a ei2213:rise in interest rates nor resurgent ei2214:inflation is ei2215:looming. Stocks ei2216:rose, ei2217:pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 72.24 points, to 8,189.49, ei2218:leaving the index within 70 points of its record high set on Aug. 6. In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of inflation anxiety, prices ei2220:edged up, ei2221:pushing down the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to 5.92 percent from 5.93 percent. ``Job ei2222:creation is sturdy and we have effective price stability,'' ei2223:said Paul McCulley, an economist at UBS Securities. ``The bottom line is that we've got a lovely economy.'' With potential inflation ei2224:counterbalanced by worries about possible price ei2225:declines, the Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, have ei2226:suggested that they ei2227:intend to ei2228:keep interest rates unchanged until the economy ei2229:tilts clearly in one direction or another. The job figures for January ei2230:extended a ei2231:surge in employment ei2232:gains that ei2233:began last fall, just when the labor market had ei2234:showed signs of cooling. After ei2235:accounting for a small downward ei2236:revision Friday to December's figures, the economy has been ei2237:creating jobs at a rate of 358,000 a month for the last four months _ and 381,000 over the last three months _ after ei2238:averaging 242,000 for the first nine months of 1997. The surge in jobs ei2239:reflects a remarkable confluence of positive and self-reinforcing economic forces. Inflation has been almost nonexistent, and consumer confidence has been extremely strong. After a short, sharp ei2240:drop when Asia's financial problems first ei2241:became clear, the stock market has ei2242:rebounded and corporate profits have ei2243:remained healthy. Long-term interest rates, an important indicator of economic stability, have ei2244:fallen in the last few months. Lower rates have ei2245:helped ei2246:invigorate housing and other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy by ei2247:making loans more affordable, and have ei2248:allowed companies to ei2249:continue ei2250:investing heavily in more efficient equipment. The likelihood that the federal budget will soon ei2251:move from deficit into surplus has further ei2252:improved the outlook. The less money the government needs to borrow, the more is freed for private investment. President Clinton ei2253:welcomed the job figures at a news ei2254:conference Friday. His advisers ei2255:said the results ei2256:reflected not just from ei2257:balancing the budget, but also ei2258:initiatives like improved access to education and training and the opening of foreign markets to trade. ``There are enormous economic and social benefits from our nation's high-employment economy,'' said Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. Some of the biggest employment gains ei2259:came in the construction industry, which ei2260:added 92,000 jobs in January. The increase ei2261:reflected the strength of the housing industry, which has been ei2262:helped not just by declining interest rates but also by unusually warm weather. Service industries also ei2263:showed solid job gains, as did manufacturers, two areas ei2264:expected to be hardest ei2265:hit when the effects of the Asian crisis ei2266:hit the American economy. The major ei2267:harm from Asia is likely to come from the ei2268:plunge in the value of many Asian currencies relative to the dollar, a situation that is ei2269:expected to ei2270:lead to a ei2271:surge of inexpensive imports into the United States, ei2272:hurting American competitors. And the weakness of the Asian economies is also likely to ei2274:lead to decreased demand for American exports. ``The economy has been ei2276:running on the fumes of the strength from before the Asia shock,'' McCulley ei2277:said. ``Those fumes will ei2278:exhaust themselves, and the manufacturing sector is going to ei2279:start getting ei2280:beat up in the spring.'' The figures ei2281:showed the unemployment rate for adult men ei2282:declined to 3.8 percent last month from 4.1 percent in December, the lowest figure for almost two decades. The rate for adult women ei2283:rose 0.4 percent, to 4.4 percent. For the first time, the Labor Department ei2284:broke out unemployment by education level as well as gender, age and race.

    "text": "NEWARK, N.J. _ A new Essex County task force ei2217:began ei2218:delving Thursday into the ei2219:slayings of 14 black women over the last five years in the Newark area, as law-enforcement officials ei2220:acknowledged that they ei2221:needed to ei2222:work harder to ei2223:solve the cases of murdered women. The police and prosecutors ei2225:said they had ei2226:identified different suspects in six of the cases and had yet to ei2227:find any pattern linking the ei2228:killings or the victims, several of whom were ei2229:believed to be prostitutes. State, county and local law-enforcement officials have ei2231:expressed concerns in recent months about a possible pattern of murdered women and a disproportionate number of unsolved cases. ei2234:Citing an example, Sgt. Derek Glenn, a spokesman for the Newark Police Department, ei2235:said that of nine women who had been ei2236:killed last year, suspects had been ei2237:arrested in only four cases. But over all, ei2239:arrests were ei2240:made in more than 60 percent of murder cases, he ei2242:said. Eight of the 14 ei2243:killings since 1993 were already under ei2244:investigation by the Newark Police Department, Glenn ei2245:said. Of the eight victims, three were ei2246:stabbed, two were ei2247:strangled, two were ei2248:beaten to death and one was ei2249:asphyxiated, he ei2250:said, and these different methods of killing and other evidence ei2251:seem to ei2252:indicate that the eight cases are not ei2254:related. But with the task-force ei2255:investigation just ei2256:getting under way, officials have been ei2257:careful not to ei2258:draw any firm conclusions, ei2259:leaving open the possibility of a serial killer in some of the cases. There have been no ei2260:arrests in any of the ei2261:slayings. ``I haven't ei2262:seen a pattern yet, '' ei2263:said Patricia Hurt, the Essex County prosecutor, who ei2264:created the task force on Tuesday. ``The type of lifestyle these women ei2265:have is extremely dangerous,'' she ei2266:said.",

    "text": "The New York Times ei2115:said in an editorial on Saturday, April 25: The Supreme Court ei2116:took a detour this week from the core principle of gender fairness it ei2117:vindicated two years ago in its ei2118:ruling ei2119:invalidating the ei2120:use of sexual stereotypes to justify denying women admission to the Virginia Military Institute. By a 6-3 vote, the court ei2121:upheld a discriminatory immigration law that gives a child born overseas to an unmarried American woman a better chance at citizenship than a child born to an unmarried American man. Under the statute, a child born abroad to an unwed American mother is automatically considered a U.S. citizen. But the child of an unwed American father has no citizenship rights unless the father takes the affirmative step of acknowledging paternity and formally agrees to provide support until the child turns 18. The majority's views were ei2122:expressed in three separate opinions, the most disquieting of which was ei2123:written by a liberal member, Justice John Paul Stevens, and ei2124:joined by a conservative, Chief Justice William Rehnquist. The opinion, which ei2126:found the gender distinction reasonable, ei2128:relied heavily on outmoded generalities about family roles, including the flawed presumption that mothers have a closer relationship to their children than fathers do. As Justice Stephen Breyer ei2129:asked in a strong ei2130:dissent, ``what sense does it make'' to apply citizenship barriers ``only to fathers and not to mothers in today's world _ where paternity can readily be proved and where women and men both are likely to earn a living in the workplace?''. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy seemed to ei2131:agree that the law ei2132:amounted to unconstitutional sex discrimination. Butinstead of ei2133:providing the votes to ei2134:strike it down, they ei2135:chose to ei2136:uphold it on the flimsy ground that because the sex of the parent and not the child made the difference under the law, the plaintiff did not have standing to ei2138:bring the case. The Justice Department, which ei2139:supported the statute, did not ei2140:cover itself with glory either. The department ei2141:retreated from its position in the VMI case when it ei2142:argued that the government could not ei2143:make ei2144:policy based on stereotypes ``even when those stereotypes ei2145:reflect current realities.'' As for the court, it ei2146:managed with its splintered ruling to ei2147:cast doubt both on the constitutionality of the immigration provisions it upheld and on its true commitment to fighting gender stereotypes.",

    "text": "Tomorrow the board of supervisors of Loudon county, Virginia, will ei539:vote on whether a school now ei540:located in Mount Vernon can ei541:relocate to their county. In some respects, that's typical county business, but tomorrow's ei542:vote has international implications. The board will ei544:decide whether the Islamic Saudi Academy, ei545:funded by the government of Saudi Arabia, can ei546:move to Ashburn village, Virginia. But local residents have not exactly ei547:laid out the red carpet for their would be neighbors. The World's Nancy Marshalll e3000:has our story.\nInside the Islamic Saudi academy in Mount Vernon, Virginia, many of the girls wear head scarves and some of the neatly dressed children are in uniforms. The instruction is in English for most classes, in Arabic for language and religious studies. The school says it teaches the children to be good Muslims and good students. They're learning a civics lesson from the residents of Loudon county. The Islamic Saudi Academy has twelve hundred mostly American students but would ei553:take thirty-five hundred if it ei554:had the room. The academy ei555:bought a hundred acres in Loudon county, Virginia, and ei556:asked for permission to ei558:build a fifty million dollar campus. In the nearby suburban housing tracts, someone ei559:dropped off leaflets ei560:warning the school could ei561:bring thousands of Middle Eastern strangers and terrorists. Some residents of the mostly white, mostly middle class area ei562:became alarmed. James Zogby of the Arab American Institute ei564:says it's a familiar story.\nThere is, a- at a very deep level in our culture, um I ei565:think, a sense of, of ignorance about Islam, a fear about who Muslims are and what they're doing.\nMany local residents ei568:denounced the bigotry, but opposition to the school then ei571:shifted. Now critics of the academy are ei572:targeting its owner, the Saudi government. Pastor James Allmen of the fellowship church and school in Ashburn has ei573:led the anti-Saudi ei574:campaign. James Allmen ei575:says he ei576:has no problem with a privately funded academy, but he ei577:has a big problem with a Saudi funded school.\nThe Saudi Arabian government has an atrocious record on human rights and is known to be one of the worst offending countries when it comes to religious persecution.\nThat's correct.\nAnd that is a condition of the application, then.\nAt a public ei578:hearing on the Islamic Saudi Academy's application, the ei579:split in county opinion was obvious, supporters of the academy, including Ann Robinson, ei580:said the Saudis were just ei581:providing a service and it was ei582:unfair to ei583:penalize children.\nWe do not ei584:further the purpose of human rights in the world by ei585:violating the human rights under our own constitution.\nBut opponents ei586:said the school might be a target for terrorist ei588:attacks, ei589:complained about its tax exempt status, and ei591:wondered why the Saudis are not ei592:compelled to ei593:allow Christians to ei594:worship in their country. Virginia Welch ei595:delivered this message to the county board of supervisors.\nI ei596:urge you to ei597:do the right thing and ei598:send a message to the Saudis that the citizens of Loudon county ei599:embrace religious and human freedom.\nLoudon county officials ei600:say they'll ei601:rule on the application based only on land use issues and ei603:ignore all the other objections. What's really behind those objections, some ei606:say, is Loudon county's ei607:collision with a new reality in America that the country is ei608:changing religiously as surely as it is racially and ethnically. ei609:According to the Arab American institute, Islam will one day be the second largest religion in the country. For an indication of the problems that could face Muslims as they integrate into American life, one need look no farther than Loudon county, Virginia. For The World, I'm Nancy Marshalll.",

    "text": "While the ei50001:expansion of the Internet has been a ei50002:blessing for researchers, students and the just plain curious, the new opportunities ei50003:mentioned by Mr. Gates are also being ei50004:used by some rather unsavory characters. A new report ei50005:says there has been a dramatic ei50006:rise in the ei50007:growth of hate groups in the United States over the past year. And many of them are ei50008:using the Internet to ei50009:spread their messages of racial superiority. VOA's Jim Teple has details from our southeast news bureau.\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights monitoring group based in Montgomery, Alabama, has long ei50010:monitored such groups as the Ku Klux Klan. More recently it has ei50011:followed the ei50012:growth of the militia movement and church groups that preach a message of white supremacy and anti-semitism. The new study written by Mark Potach, who edits the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Report, ei50013:warns that such groups ei50014:grew rapidly last year, mostly by ei50015:recruiting younger members. Mr. Potach ei50016:says the ei50017:growth is ei50018:surprising since membership in hate groups usually declines during periods of economic prosperity.\nWe in fact have ei50019:seen hate group numbers ei50020:dropping through the nineties, uh but this year they ei50021:jumped up uh twenty percent, quite a dramatic ei50022:rise.\nMark Potach ei50023:says over four hundred hate groups have been ei50024:identified and many are ei50025:becoming increasingly ei50026:successful at recruiting younger members through the ei50028:use of Internet web pages and the promotion of racist rock music.\nThe Internet has certainly ei50030:helped uh hate mongers to ei50031:organize and uh to ei50032:feel that they are part of a larger community, even if uh they are essentially uh, you know, angry people sitting in their bedrooms uh all alone. Uh, in addition, white power racist music has ei50033:become uh quite popular in certain sectors. Uh, there are over fifty thousand CDs a year ei50035:sold with uh lyrics that are quite uh unbelievable.\nMany of these new members are ei50036:joining chapters of the so called Christian Identity Movement which cites Biblical scripture as a foundation for a belief in white supremacy and anti-semitism. Mark Potach ei50037:says such members are also intensely ei50038:attracted to apocalyptical fantasies.\nThe ei50039:approach of the year two thousand has many of these groups in a kind of millennial frenzy. Uh, uh a- they ei50041:believe, or at least many of them ei50042:believe, uh that they are ei50043:approaching the Battle of Armageddon in which they will be pitted against the uh kind of Satanic forces ei50045:trying to ei50046:take over the world.\nMr. Potach ei50047:notes older, more traditional groups like the Ku Klux Klan are also ei50048:opening new chapters, thanks in part to their ei50049:ability to ei50050:use new technologies like the Internet. The Federal Bureau of Investigation ei50051:says it ei50052:received more than eight thousand ei50053:reports of hate group ei50054:crimes last year. Law enforcement authorities ei50055:say such reports are likely to ei50056:increase as police departments are now ei50057:beginning to more accurately ei50058:report hate ei50059:crimes than they ei50060:have in the past.

    "text": "International Women's Day is this coming Sunday, March eighth. A major focus of International Women's Day is the plight of Afghan women. Special ei430:events are being ei431:organized by the European Commission and individual nations in Europe, North America, and other parts of the world. Lisa Schlein reports from Geneva.\nAfghanistan has been at war for twenty years, ei433:leaving a large part of the country's male population dead or in exile. The United Nations ei436:says women and children ei437:make up about seventy-five percent of the Afghan population. An Afghan refugee in Switzerland, Homira Atimadi, is a senior official of a group called the International Working Group on Afghan Women. The group has branches in Pakistan, Iran, Europe, Australia, and North America. Ms. Atimadi ei438:says Afghan women have been victims of severe ei440:violations of human rights for the past twenty years and she ei441:says she ei442:sees no ei443:end to the misery. She ei445:says security under the fundamentalist Taleban government is ei447:better, but everything else is ei448:worse.\nWomen do not ei449:become victims of armed ei451:attack, but they do not have the right to ei454:work. And today, the right to work is ei455:equal to r- the right to survival.\nMs. Atimadi ei456:says the ei457:war has ei458:created a nation of widows. Women have ei460:become the sole ei461:support of their families. Yet, the Taliban have ei462:forbidden them to ei463:work. She ei464:says this ei465:puts the very existence of women's families at risk. She ei467:says the plight of women in urban areas is ei469:greater than that which exists in rural parts of the country. In cities, such as the capital Kabul, women are totally ei470:dependent on international aid for survival. Ms. Atimadi ei472:says the women of Kabul ei473:symbolize the suffering of all the women in Afghanistan.\nThe aim is to ei475:bring in not only the focus on women's right to education, access to work, but ei476:look beyond that and ei477:look at the roots of, uh of these problems. These are only the symptoms of the problems that are ei478:facing Afghanistan. For women in Afghanistan to be ei490:able to ei480:realize their rights, there have to be conditions of peace and justice.\nMs. Atimadi ei482:says that is the primary focus of her group, peace and justice. She ei484:says her group is ei485:appealing to individuals, to the international community, and to the combatants and people of Afghanistan to ei486:stop the ei487:bloodletting which has ei488:torn the country apart.

    "text": "The US government recently ei267:announced new regulations ei268:designed to ei269:change the way transplant organs are made available to sick patients. Under the new guidelines, donor organs will be made available to the sickest people first, wherever they live in the country. Currently, transplant organs are rationed through a regional system of distribution. The private group that ei270:runs the current system, United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, objects to the new regulations. UNOS ei271:says the regulations ei272:put the federal government in charge of ei273:deciding who ei274:gets transplants and that many hospital transplant centers would be ei276:forced to ei277:close. Health and Human Services Secretary Do- Donna Shalala ei278:says patients who ei279:need an organ transplant should not have to ei282:take a chance that an organ will ei283:become available in their local area, nor should patients have to ei285:travel to transplant centers far from their homes to ei286:improve their chances of ei287:getting an organ. UNOS spokeswoman Donna Henry Wright ei288:says the new policy would not necessarily be more ei319:fair or ei320:effective because allowances are already ei290:made for the most needy patients.\nThe sickest patients are already ei291:treated first. There are not huge waiting uh disparit- waiting time disparities amongst the very uh sickest patients. It's between two to six days for every one uh of the sickest patients across the country. um So it's a- it's a fallacy that they're ei294:doing this because um the sickest patients aren't being ei295:served.\nDoctor James Burdick, the Professor of Transplant Surgery at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, and former President of UNOS, ei296:said the current system has ei297:evolved over several years and it ei298:works well.\nYou may, in a year or two, ei299:save a few more lives if you do sickest first. But the number of patients ei301:waiting then ei302:begins to ei303:increase, um and, in fact, um over the years many more patients who are about to die of liver tra- uh without a liver transplant would ei305:accumulate. If you ei306:do the uh alternative extreme, you don't ei307:save as many lives in the early years, by a small fraction. Our system ei308:is balanced, it's right in the middle. And, therefore, it ei309:works very well.\nNationwide, there are about ten thousand patients ei310:waiting for liver transplants each year and only four thousand organs ei312:become available for ei313:transplants. Secretary Shalala ei314:says UNOS five months ago, or ei315:gave them five months to ei316:develop a new ei317:plan to ei318:distribute livers which are in the shortest supply. This is VOA Today.",

    "text": "Iraq's Saddam Hussein, his options for ei1127:ending the Persian Gulf ei1128:crisis growing increasingly unpleasant, ei1129:assumed the ei1130:role of embattled Arab hero in ei1131:offering his first rough ei1132:proposal for a negotiated ei1133:end to the ei1134:confrontation. The Iraqi leader, in an \"ei1135:initiative\" ei1136:designed as much to ei1137:rally Arab public ei1138:opinion as to ei1139:launch meaningful ei1140:negotiations, ei1141:announced yesterday that he will ei1142:withdraw his troops from Kuwait only if Israel ei1143:withdraws from the West Bank and Syria from Lebanon. He apparently ei1144:hopes to ei1145:lure ei1146:support from Arabs who have ei1147:spurned him so far by ei1148:suggesting that Iraq will ei1149:use its ei1150:occupation of Kuwait as a lever to ei1151:solve the Arab world's most frustrating ei1152:problem, the 23-year Israeli ei1153:occupation of land ei1154:claimed by Palestinians.\nEven as Saddam Hussein was ei1155:searching for a ei1156:ploy to ei1157:ease his isolation, though, the international ei1159:pressure against him ei1160:clicked up another notch. The White House yesterday ei1161:disclosed that Kuwait's ousted government has formally ei1162:asked the U.S. to ei1163:enforce the total trade ei1164:embargo the United Nations has ei1165:imposed on Iraq, ei1166:allowing the U.S. and other nations to immediately ei1167:begin ei1168:stopping ships carrying Iraqi goods. Secretary of State James Baker, ei1170:speaking on ABC News' \"This Week,\" ei1171:said the Kuwaiti ei1172:request ei1173:gives the U.S. and other countries \"a legal basis for ei1174:stopping the ei1175:export of oil and that sort of thing.\" The U.S. ei1176:maintains that under the U.N. charter, the Kuwaiti ei1177:request ei1178:triggers steps for the collective ei1179:enforcement of international ei1180:sanctions. Mr. Baker ei1181:declined to ei1182:use the word blockade, but ei1184:said that \"ei1185:interdiction\" of Iraqi ei1186:shipments would ei1187:begin \" almost instantly.\" In a ei1188:statement, the White House ei1189:said it would ei1190:do \"whatever is necessary\" to ei1191:ensure compliance with the ei1193:sanctions. Other Bush administration officials ei1194:said that the international naval force in the area -- consisting of American, British, French, Canadian, Soviet, German and Australian ships -- may be ei1195:used both to ei1196:stop oil exports from ei1198:leaving Iraq and Kuwait and to ei1199:stop shipments of food and other goods from ei1201:going in. President Bush ei1202:implied as much yesterday when reporters ei1203:asked whether the ei1204:interdiction would ei1205:apply to food. The president ei1206:responded, \"Everything, everything.\" While ei1207:shying away from actually ei1208:using the word \"blockade,\" Mr. Bush ei1210:acknowledged that the U.S. and others were ei1211:trying to ei1212:block ei1213:shipping to Iraq. \"No point getting into all these semantics,\" he ei1214:said. \"The main thing is to ei1215:stop the oil from ei1216:coming out of there.\" The naval interdiction force is part of an overall American strategy that officials say is designed to leave the Iraqi leader with only the stark choice of backing out of Kuwait or launching new attacks to change his situation. Though they insist they aren't e3000:trying to lure Saddam Hussein into an attack, officials hope that if he strikes again, the U.S. and its allies will have such an impressive force in place in Saudi Arabia that they will be able to crush him in retaliation. Iraq's first option, of course, may be simply to sit tight and hope it can endure a trade embargo longer than the West can live without Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. Speaking on the ABC program, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's ambassador to the U.N., asserted that an embargo on Iraq could plunge the U.S. into a \"depression\" and the rest of the world into an economic \"crisis.\" Iraq clearly is trying to ei1224:woo back more Arab ei1225:support in case the ei1226:conflict ei1227:drags on, ei1228:hoping that its neighbors eventually will ei1229:help it ei1230:survive a prolonged ei1231:war of economic attrition with the West. So Saddam Hussein on Friday ei1232:tried to ei1233:scare other Arab leaders into ei1234:supporting him by ei1235:calling on Arabs to ei1236:rise up in a holy ei1237:war against leaders who ei1238:invited American and other Western soldiers into Saudi Arabia to ei1239:protect the oil-rich kingdom. Then yesterday, he ei1240:tried to ei1241:entice Arab leaders with his ei1242:proposal for a diplomatic solution ei1244:linking his ei1245:occupation of Kuwait with Israel's ei1246:occupation of the West Bank. The ei1247:proposal also ei1248:called for ei1249:replacing American and other Western troops in Saudi Arabia with Arab forces. The Bush administration immediately ei1250:said it \"categorically \" ei1251:rejects the ei1252:proposals. And President Bush yesterday, ei1253:asked whether he was at least glad Iraq is ei1254:discussing ei1255:negotiations, ei1256:replied: \"I don't ei1257:see anything to be ei1258:pleasing in there at all.\" American strategists are calculating, though, that the trade sanctions -- enforced by an effective though perhaps undeclared naval blockade -- will hold tightly enough to convince Iraq that it will lose in the long run by simply standing pat. At that point, rather than ei1259:go through the humiliation of ei1260:backing out of Kuwait, the Iraqis might well ei1261:conclude that they ei1262:need to ei1263:lash out in some way to ei1264:shake things up. In that event, Saddam Hussein ei1265:appears to ei1266:have three choices. The first would be to ei1268:launch the much-feared direct ei1269:invasion of Saudi Arabia, ei1270:hoping to ei1271:seize some Saudi oil fields and ei1272:improve his bargaining position. But that option is ei1274:growing less and less likely as thousands of American, British, Egyptian, Syrian and Moroccan forces ei1275:assemble in and around Saudi Arabia to ei1276:protect the kingdom. The Saudis even have in their possession 48 Kuwaiti jet fighters, virtually the entire Kuwaiti air force, which ei1278:managed to ei1279:escape the Iraqi ei1280:invasion, Saudi officials ei1281:said. The Saudi \"window of vulnerability... is ei1282:closing very fast,\" Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, ei1283:said over the weekend. The second possibility would be to ei1285:start a ei1286:fight with Israel, in hopes that all Arabs would have to ei1288:move behind Iraq in a ei1289:fight against their common Israeli enemy. In such an event, Saddam Hussein also might ei1290:calculate, the Saudis would be under pressure to ei1292:kick out U.S. troops because of America's close ties with Israel. Iraq could ei1293:start ei1294:hostilities with Israel either through a direct ei1295:attack or by ei1296:attacking Jordan. Israel has publicly ei1297:declared that it will ei1298:respond to an Iraqi ei1299:attack on Jordan because it won't ei1300:allow Iraq's dangerous army to ei1381:take control of Jordan's long border with Israel. Iraq's third attack option would be to ei1303:start an undeclared ei1304:war on the U.S. and other Western nations through terrorism. Two Middle East terrorists with records of successful attacks against Western targets, Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas, have ties to Baghdad. And even terrorist groups that opposed Iraq in its war with Iran show signs of swinging behind Saddam Hussein now that he is in a confrontation with the U.S. And Iraq still ei1306:has thousands of Americans and other Westerners under its control in Iraq and Kuwait. They aren't being ei1307:allowed to ei1308:leave and could ei1309:become hostages. If Iraq chooses a simple war of nerves and economic attrition, the Bush administration knows a long stalemate could try the patience of the American public and the West in general, and could open the possibility that moderate Arabs -- even including Saudi Arabia -- might drop out of the effort against Iraq and accept some deal from Saddam Hussein. But U.S. officials have ei1310:sized up Saddam Hussein as a man who, despite some recklessness, will ei1311:back down if he must. \"This is a guy who is impulsive, and therefore capable of big miscalculations,\" ei1313:says one senior administration official involved in ei1315:managing the ei1316:crisis. The official ei1317:adds, though, that \"at the same time, we ei1318:think he is someone who is ei1380:capable of rational judgments when it comes to power. And when he ei1320:finds something is unprofitable, then one can ei1321:see certain ei1322:accommodations.\" Thus, administration aides will be ei1323:trying to ei1324:calculate whether Saddam Hussein's proposed diplomatic formula for ei1326:getting out of Kuwait ei1327:represents the first sign he is ei1329:searching for a way out or simply is a public relations ei1331:stunt. There are disagreements among experts about how much pressure will be needed to make Saddam Hussein decide he's up against the wall and whether simple economic pressure will ever be enough. The biggest worry is that if he decides he needs a way out of his predicament but doesn't e3001:see a face-saving method, he could lash out in dangerous and unpredictable ways. U.S. officials claim they already see signs Saddam Hussein is getting nervous. In the first days after President Bush ei1335:announced the ei1336:dispatching of U.S. troops, they note, the Iraqi leader ei1337:made several nationwide ei1338:addresses indirectly -- having them ei1340:read by a television announcer. \"That ei1341:shows he's nervous about ei1342:pinpointing his location, either because he's afraid we'll ei1343:find him, or that internal enemies will,\" ei1344:says one U.S. official. The unpredictability of Iraq's leader is a principal reason the U.S. is going to such great lengths to build a mammoth force in and around Saudi Arabia. Pentagon officials ei1345:say the goal is to ei1347:put 40,000 troops in the region by the end of the month. But the administration isn't ei1348:putting any upper limit on how high the force could ei1350:go after that, ei1351:calculating that it would be a ei1352:mistake to ei1353:underestimate and an advantage to ei1354:keep Saddam Hussein ei1355:guessing. U.S. commanders in charge of ei1356:planning for Middle East ei1357:crises have ei1358:indicated in the past that they were ei1359:capable of ei1360:deploying as many as 300,000 troops. And the U.S. is ei1361:taking similar steps to ei1362:ensure that its naval force is ei1379:adequate to ei1363:carry out a ei1364:blockade of Iraq and ei1365:support a ei1366:war if necessary. Over the weekend, Pentagon officials ei1367:confirmed reports that a fourth U.S. aircraft carrier -- the John F. Kennedy -- and its powerful group of support ships could ei1369:head for the Middle East within a few days. Three other carriers and their escort vessels already are ei1370:stationed within striking distance of Iraq or are ei1371:steaming toward the area. But unless the military situation ei1372:changes drastically, military officials ei1373:say, the most likely plan will be for the Kennedy to eventually ei1374:replace the carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower, which has been on patrol since March and was ei1376:scheduled to ei1377:return to port before hostilities ei1378:erupted in Kuwait. --- Andy Pasztor contributed to this article.",

    "text": "\"So far, the ei1189:offensive is progressing with dramatic success,\" ei1191:said a buoyant Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces. Similarly, while cautioning about the uncertainty of early battle reports, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater ei1195:said late yesterday that \"the ei1196:operation has been very successful.\" Amid reports that thousands of Iraqi soldiers had ei1198:surrendered, administration aides were also upbeat in private, with one even ei1199:talking of victory within a week. But even continued military success ei1202:carries political and diplomatic risks for President Bush and the U.S. The allied ei1204:rejection of the last-minute Soviet-led diplomatic ei1205:effort to ei1206:avoid the ground ei1207:war ei1208:enabled Mr. Bush to ei1209:seize the initiative from an Iraq seemingly bent on ei1210:dictating peace terms. But it has ei1211:offended some, especially in Arab countries, who now ei1212:believe that Mr. Bush's real objectives are the ei1214:demise of Saddam Hussein and the ei1215:destruction of the Iraqi military, not just the ei1216:liberation of Kuwait. \"Why have a ei1217:war?\" ei1218:asked Abdul Latif Shekar, a customs officer in Egypt, a country ei1219:participating in the ei1220:attack on Iraqi troops. \"I ei1221:think the Gorbachev plan was a good one. Iraq was ready to ei1222:withdraw.\" Now, he ei1223:says, \"it ei1224:looks like the West just ei1225:wants to ei1226:destroy Iraq.\" Despite the early indications of success, the allied forces could still ei1228:suffer greater casualties and ei1230:become ei1231:bogged down militarily, especially when they ei1232:encounter the tough Republican Guard, which is ei1233:entrenched along the Iraq-Kuwait border. If so, and if it ei1234:appears that the American goal actually is to ei1236:destroy the Iraqi regime even at the cost of badly hurting Iraqi society, \"the lingering cost of that could be high,\" ei1239:worries former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. But, he ei1240:notes, \"If everything ei1241:crumbles totally, that won't be such a problem.\" American officials staunchly ei1242:disavow any interest in ei1243:driving through Iraq toward Baghdad, either in ei1244:pursuit of Saddam Hussein himself or to ei1245:set up some American-controlled government inside Iraq. The Americans ei1246:say their battle plans ei1247:call for ei1248:operating against forces inside Iraq as far north as the city of Basra, about 30 miles north of Kuwait, but say there isn't any plan to ei1251:drive beyond that. Indeed, French President Francois Mitterrand ei1252:said yesterday that some allied forces are ei1253:crossing Iraqi territory as part of a \"pincer\" movement to ei1255:trap the soldiers occupying Kuwait, but ei1257:insisted, \"The purpose isn't to ei1259:invade Iraqi territory, that's not the aim, that isn't the mandate.\" Nevertheless, American officials over the weekend ei1262:became more ei1263:open in ei1264:declaring that by ei1265:destroying Saddam Hussein's military machine they ei1266:hope to ei1267:destroy his regime -- a goal likely to be ei1270:supported by most Americans. In a pre-attack message, Lt. Gen. Walter Boomer, the top Marine in the Persian Gulf, ei1272:told U.S. Marines that their goal is to \" ei1274:restore {Kuwait} to its citizens.\" He ei1275:went on to ei1276:add that \"in so ei1277:doing you not only ei1278:return a nation to its people, but you will ei1279:destroy the war machine of a ruthless dictator.\" Secretary of State James Baker ei1280:said on ABC-TV's \"This Week With David Brinkley\" that the series of United Nations resolutions ei1282:condemning Iraq's ei1283:invasion of Kuwait \"ei1284:imply that the ei1285:restoration of peace and stability in the Gulf would be a heck of a lot easier if he and that leadership were not in power in Iraq.\" Of course, it is still far too early to ei1290:assume that the military ei1291:situation on the ground will ei1292:stay as smooth for allied forces as it ei1293:appears to have been so far. Iraq still ei1295:has the potential to ei1296:cause significant problems by ei1298:using forces and weapons that don't yet ei1299:seem fully ei1300:engaged. For one thing, Iraq still apparently hasn't ei1301:unleashed its stockpile of chemical weapons. Gen. Schwarzkopf ei1302:said that some early reports that chemical weapons were ei1304:used against allied troops ei1305:turned out to be \"bogus.\" Iraq is ei1306:believed to ei1307:have the ability to ei1308:deliver chemical weapons in artillery shells or, perhaps, atop Soviet-made Frog7 missiles. Perhaps more important, it ei1309:appears that allied troops haven't yet fully ei1310:engaged Iraq's vaunted Republican Guard, which has been ei1311:sitting just north of the Iraq-Kuwait border and is ei1312:considered the most potent element in the Iraqi defense. It ei1314:remains to be ei1315:seen how much ei1316:damage the allied air ei1317:campaign was able to ei1319:inflict on the Guard, and whether President Hussein will ei1320:commit his most valued troops to a fight-to-the-death finish. Certainly Saddam Hussein ei1322:continues to ei1323:implore his country to ei1324:fight on. \"ei1325:Fight them,\" he ei1326:urged Iraqis in a radio ei1327:address. \"All Iraqis, ei1328:fight them with all the power you ei1329:have, and all ei1330:struggle for everything.\" American war planners have long ei1331:assumed that the early stage of the ground ei1332:attack, in which American forces would ei1333:use their speed to ei1334:sweep around Iraqi defenses and their strength to ei1335:punch through the relatively weak Iraqi front line, would be the easiest part. Despite these early successes, the mere fact that a ground ei1336:campaign has ei1337:begun almost ei1338:guarantees that the Bush administration will ei1339:face fresh problems ei1341:growing out of the military ei1342:situation. There are likely to be additional American prisoners of war taken, and there are signs that President Hussein is ei1344:taking Kuwaiti hostages. U.S. and Kuwaiti officials ei1345:say there are reports that large numbers of civilians from Kuwait City are being ei1347:rounded up and ei1348:held by Iraqi troops, apparently either for ei1349:use as human shields or for ei1350:use later in ei1351:bargaining once the ei1352:war is over. President Bush's political argument for ei1354:going to a ground ei1355:war has been ei1356:strengthened by the growing stream of reports of wanton Iraqi ei1358:destruction inside Kuwait. U.S. officials ei1359:say that hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells now may have been ei1360:set afire. And Robert Gates, Mr. Bush's deputy national security adviser, ei1362:asserted in an ei1363:interview on the Cable News Network that Iraqi troops have ei1364:set fire to \"large sections\" of Kuwait City. Mr. Bush and his aides were ei1366:leaning toward a military ei1367:conclusion of the ei1368:crisis even before the latest reports of Iraqi ei1370:atrocities in Kuwait ei1371:came to light. The president and his top aides tentatively ei1372:decided on Feb. 11 that a ground ei1373:war would be ei1529:necessary. The ei1375:decision was ei1376:made after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ei1377:returned from a ei1378:visit with military commanders in Saudi Arabia, administration officials ei1379:say. Then, a week or so ago, Gen. Schwarzkopf secretly ei1380:picked Saturday night as the optimal time to ei1381:start the ei1382:offensive. The date was ei1383:unaffected by the last-ditch Soviet peace ei1384:initiative. The real problem with the Soviet proposals, U.S. officials now ei1387:say, was that they all would have ei1388:required ei1389:lifting economic ei1390:sanctions against Iraq. The Bush administration ei1391:considers the ei1392:sanctions essential to ei1393:keeping Saddam Hussein under control should he ei1395:survive the ei1396:war. Mr. Bush ei1397:forestalled further diplomatic ei1398:maneuvering by ei1399:issuing an ultimatum on behalf of the allies ei1401:demanding that Iraq ei1402:withdraw within a week, ei1403:starting at noon Saturday. Administration aides ei1404:said that the idea of the ultimatum was Gen. Powell's. He ei1406:argued ei1407:setting an explicit deadline for Saddam Hussein to ei1408:break would, when it was ei1409:broken, ei1410:give the U.S. military a clear green light to ei1411:proceed. In ei1412:setting out his final challenge to Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush ei1414:continued the intensive personal ei1415:diplomacy he ei1416:began after the ei1417:invasion last August. After ei1418:cabling world leaders about his intention to ei1420:give Saddam Hussein a final deadline to ei1421:exit Kuwait, he ei1422:offered him a week to ei1423:withdraw fully, instead of the four days he originally ei1424:considered, because of ei1425:objections from some European partners that four days ei1426:seemed punitive and unrealistic. And when he and President Gorbachev ei1427:spoke about the ei1428:decision in a ei1429:talk lasting nearly an hour, the President ei1430:took pains to ei1432:listen to what his counterpart had to ei1434:say, although he already had ei1435:decided that the Soviet alternative to the allied deadline was ei1530:unacceptable. Finally, when Iraq ei1437:failed to ei1438:respond to the U.S. ultimatum, Mr. Bush ei1440:let the ground ei1441:offensive ei1442:begin as previously ei1443:planned Saturday night. The ei1444:attack was lightning quick, as allied forces ei1445:punched through tall sand berms on the border and ei1446:pushed forward into Iraq and Kuwait. U.S. Marines were ei1447:said to have ei1448:breached troublesome mine fields along the Iraqi lines but Pentagon officials ei1449:said no amphibious ei1450:assault on Kuwait's beaches had ei1451:begun. Long columns of Iraqi prisoners of war could be ei1452:seen ei1453:trudging through the desert toward the allied rear. U.S. commanders ei1454:said 5,500 Iraqi prisoners were ei1455:taken in the first hours of the ground ei1456:war, though some military officials later ei1457:said the total may have ei1458:climbed above 8,000. The U.S. ei1459:hopes its troops will ei1460:drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait quickly, ei1461:leaving much of Iraq's offensive military equipment ei1462:destroyed or ei1463:abandoned in Kuwait. It ei1464:expects that tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers will ei1465:surrender to the U.S. and its allies over the next few days. If the allies ei1466:succeed, Saddam Hussein will have ei1467:plunged his country first into a fruitless eight-year ei1468:war against Iran and then into a humiliating ei1469:war against the U.S. and the allies to ei1470:defend his ei1471:conquest of Kuwait, ei1472:leaving much of his country's military establishment and modern infrastructure in ruins. Meanwhile, the U.S. ei1474:hopes, economic ei1475:sanctions and an international arms ei1476:embargo will ei1477:remain in effect until Iraq ei1478:pays war reparations to Kuwait to ei1480:cover war damages. That would ei1482:undermine any chances of ei1483:rebuilding either Iraq or its armed forces in short order as long as Saddam Hussein ei1484:remains in power. The American hope is that someone from within Iraq, perhaps from the army's professional ranks, will step forward and push Saddam Hussein aside so that the country can begin recovering from the disaster. Outside analysts e369:think Saddam Hussein's position is indeed precarious. \"I think frankly Saddam is ei1486:finished, no matter what ei1487:happens,\" ei1488:says Christine Helms, a Middle East scholar who has ei1489:written extensively about Iraq. \"These guys simply don't ei1490:retire to condos over the Euphrates.\" Despite the lack of any obvious successors, the Iraqi leader's internal power base ei1491:appeared to be ei1492:narrowing even before the ei1493:war ei1494:began. Some analysts ei1495:say he ei1496:appeared to be ei1497:relying on a smaller and smaller circle of close advisers and relatives. If that's true, the narrowing of his support would ei1499:make it easier for someone to ei1500:push him aside from within. Yet, paradoxically, the perception that the U.S. ei1501:wants to ei1502:destroy Iraq may ei1503:increase Saddam Hussein's support within the Iraqi military. And the U.S. now will ei1505:face sharper questions in the Arab world since it didn't ei1506:back the peace proposals worked out in Moscow. \"We ei1508:looked to the United States, we ei1509:expected you to ei1510:have the moral edge,\" ei1511:says Nasser Tahboub, a Jerusalem-born Jordanian who ei1512:has an American wife and a doctorate in political science from Duke University. \"Now we ei1513:see that edge ei1514:eroded. For me, it is a great ei1515:tragedy. For the first time in history, the U.S. has ei1516:gone to ei1517:war with an Arab and Muslim nation, and we ei1518:know a peaceful solution was in reach.\" --- Geraldine Brooks in Amman, Jordan, and Craig Forman in Cairo, Egypt, contributed to this article.",

In addition, Courtaulds ei2016:said the ei2017:moves are logical because they will ei2018:allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to ei2019:focus more closely on core activities.\nCourtaulds has been ei2033:under pressure to ei2021:enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier Kerry Packer -- ei2022:surfaced holding small stakes last year. Though Mr. Packer has since ei2023:sold his stake, Courtaulds is ei2024:moving to ei2025:keep its institutional shareholders happy. Even without a specific takeover threat, Courtaulds is ei2028:giving shareholders \"choice and value,\" ei2030:said Julia Blake, an analyst at London stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd.\nIn a statement, the company said: \"Both parts can only realize their full potential and be appropriately valued by the market if they are separately quoted companies. The sharper definition and the autonomy which each will thereby gain will benefit shareholders, customers and employees.\"\nCourtaulds Chairman and Chief Executive Sir Christopher Hogg will ei2031:remain in both posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff.",

Roughly $2 billion of that debt has already been ei2008:repaid from previous asset sales, and RJR ei2009:expects to ei2010:use another $2 billion from the pending, two-part ei2011:sale of most of its Del Monte unit. That ei2012:sale, however, could still ei2013:fall through if financing problems ei2014:develop. Thus, it remains crucial for RJR to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands.\nLouis Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based RJR, called the sale a \"significant step\" in the company's divestiture program, as well as a \"a strategic divestiture.\" Since KKR ei2015:bought RJR in February for $25 billion of debt, it has ei2016:agreed to ei2017:sell nearly $5 billion of RJR assets. RJR's executives have ei2018:said they will ei2019:dispense with certain brands, in particular, that aren't ei2020:leaders in their markets. \"RJR Nabisco and Planters LifeSavers will ei2021:concentrate more on our own core businesses,\" Mr. Gerstner ei2022:said Friday.\nBaby Ruth and Butterfinger are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the U.S., but RJR's overall share of the roughly $5.1 billion market is less than 5%. Nestle's share of 7% before Friday's ei2024:purchases is far below the shares of market leaders Hershey Foods Corp. and Mars Inc., which have about 40% and 36% of the market, respectively.\n\"This means Nestle is now in the candybar business in a big way,\" ei2025:said Lisbeth Echeandia, publisher of Orlando, Fla.-based Confectioner Magazine. \"For them, it makes all kinds of sense. They've been ei2026:given a mandate from Switzerland\" to ei2027:expand their U.S. chocolate operations. Nestle S.A. is based in Vevey, Switzerland.\nThe new candy bars, \"ei2029:make an important ei2030:contribution to our Nestle Foods commitment to this very important strategic unit,\" ei2031:said C.

    "text": "Unisys Corp.'s ei2806:announcement Friday of a $648.2 million ei2807:loss for the third quarter showed that the company is ei2808:moving even faster than ei2809:expected to ei2810:take ei2811:write-offs on its various problems and ei2812:prepare for a ei2813:turnaround next year.\nAt the same time, the sheer size of the ei2814:loss, coupled with a slowing of ei2815:orders, ei2816:made some securities analysts ei2817:wonder just how strong that turnaround will be at the computer maker and defense-electronics concern.\n\"Unisys is ei2819:getting ei2820:clobbered. Just clobbered,\" ei2821:said Ulric Weil, an analyst at Weil amp Associates who had once been ei2933:high on the company. \"The quarter was terrible, and the future looks anything but encouraging.\"\nUnisys, whose revenue ei2823:inched up 3.7% in the quarter to $2.35 billion from $2.27 billion in the year-earlier quarter, ei2826:had an operating ei2827:loss of about $30 million. On top of that, the Blue Bell, Pa., concern ei2828:took a $230 million ei2829:charge related to the ei2830:layoffs of 8,000 employees. That is at the high end of the range of 7,000 to 8,000 employees that Unisys ei2831:said a month ago would be ei2832:laid off. Unisys ei2833:said that should ei2834:help it ei2835:save $500 million a year in costs, again at the high end of the previously reported range of $400 million to $500 million.\nThe company also ei2837:took a ei2838:write-off of $150 million to ei2839:cover ei2840:losses on some fixed-price defense contracts, as some new managers ei2841:took a hard ei2842:look at the prospects for that slow-growing business. In addition, Unisys ei2844:set up an unspecified reserve -- apparently $60 million to $70 million -- to ei2845:cover the minimum amount it will have to ei2846:pay the government because of its ei2847:involvement in the defense-procurement ei2848:scandal. Unisys also ei2849:noted that it ei2850:paid $78.8 million in taxes during the quarter, even though tax e3000:payments normally would be minimal in a quarter that produced such a big loss.\nThe tax payments will ei2852:leave Unisys with $225 million in loss carry-forwards that will ei2853:cut tax ei2854:payments in future quarters. In addition, Unisys ei2855:said it ei2856:reduced computer inventories a further $100 million during the quarter, ei2857:leaving it within $100 million of its goal of a ei2859:reduction of $500 million by the end of the year.\nStill, Unisys ei2860:said its European business was ei2861:weak during the quarter, a worrisome sign given that the company has ei2862:relied on solid results overseas to ei2863:overcome weakness in the U.S. over the past several quarters.\nThe company also ei2865:reported slower ei2866:growth in another important business: systems that use the Unix operating system. That would be a huge ei2867:problem if it were to ei2868:continue, because Unisys is ei2869:betting its business on the assumption that customers ei2871:want to ei2872:move away from using operating systems that run on only one manufacturer's equipment and toward systems -- mainly Unix -- that work on almost anyone's machines.\nIn addition, Unisys must ei2873:deal with its increasingly oppressive debt load. Debt has ei2875:risen to around $4 billion, or about 50% of total capitalization. That means Unisys must ei2877:pay about $100 million in interest every quarter, on top of $27 million in dividends on preferred stock.\nJim Unruh, Unisys's president, ei2878:said he is ei2879:approaching next year with caution. He ei2880:said the strength of the world-wide economy is ei2881:suspect, and doesn't see much revenue growth in the cards.\nHe also ei2882:said that the price wars ei2883:flaring up in parts of the computer industry will ei2884:continue through next year. He ei2885:said the ei2886:move toward standard operating systems means customers aren't ei2887:locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down. That, he ei2888:said, is why Unisys is ei2889:overhauling its whole business: It ei2890:needs to ei2891:prepare for a world in which profit margins will be ei2892:lower than computer companies have been ei2893:used to.\n\"We've ei2894:approached this not as a response to a temporary condition in the industry but as a fundamental change the industry is going through,\" Mr. Unruh ei2895:said. \"The information-systems industry is still going to be a high-growth ei2896:business, and we're ei2897:confident that we ei2898:have tremendous assets as a company. But we don't ei2899:minimize the ei2900:challenges of the near term.\"\nSecurities analysts were even more ei2901:cautious, having been ei2902:burned repeatedly on Unisys this year. Some had ei2903:predicted ei2932:earnings of more than $4 a share for this year, up from last year's fully diluted $3.27 a share on earnings of $680.6 million. But the company ei2906:said Friday that it ei2907:had ei2908:losses of $673.3 million through the first nine months, compared with ei2909:earnings a year earlier of $382.2 million, or $2.22 a share fully diluted, as revenue ei2910:inched up 1.4% to $7.13 billion from $7.03 billion. And Unisys is ei2913:expected to ei2914:do little better than break even in the fourth quarter.\nSo Steve Milunovich at First Boston ei2915:said he is ei2916:cutting his earnings ei2918:estimate for next year to $2 a share from $3. \"I was feeling like I was too high to begin with,\" he e3001:said.\nMr. Weil of Weil amp Associates said he will ei2922:remain at $1 a share for next year but ei2923:said he ei2924:wonders whether even that low target is ei2942:at risk. \"The break-even point for next year is much ei2926:lower, but is it ei2943:low enough?\" he ei2928:asked.\nReflecting the concern, Unisys stock ei2930:fell a further 75 cents to $16.25 in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.",

Through the first nine months, the company ei2688:had a ei2689:loss of $484 million, largely reflecting the ei2690:closing of its supercomputer unit.\nWhile a few assets are still being shopped -- including the sports and entertainment ticketing portion of the company's Ticketron unit -- Mr. Price ei2691:said future restructuring would be a question of strategy. \"We don't ei2692:need the cash.\"\nTicketron's automated wagering business, which operates lotteries in a half dozen states, is not for sale, the company ei2695:said. Rather, Mr. Perlman ei2696:said, Control Data ei2697:intends to ei2698:bid for the coming Minnesota lottery contract and is ei2699:seeking new applications for the technology overseas, where \"there is great interest in games of skill.\" He wouldn't ei2701:elaborate.\nControl Data's semiconductor business, VTC Inc., ei2702:continues to ei2703:lose money, the executives ei2704:acknowledged, but they ei2705:said they consider some of the technology vital to national defense and so are ei2706:reluctant to ei2707:dispose of it.\nThe company's strategy for keeping its computer products business profitable -- it recently ei2708:achieved profitability after several quarters of ei2710:losses -- calls for a narrow focus and a lid on expenses. Partly, costs will be ei2711:held down through strategic technology alliances, management ei2712:said. Control Data recently ei2713:announced an ei2714:agreement with MIPS Computer Systems Inc. to jointly ei2715:develop machines with simplified operating software.\nJames E. Ousley, computer products group president, ei2716:said such arrangements could ei2718:help ei2719:slash Control Data's computer research and development costs in half by the end of 1990. He ei2720:disclosed that before Control Data ei2721:scrapped its ETA Systems Inc. supercomputer business this past spring, those costs were ei2722:running at nearly 35% of group revenue. At the same time four of six design projects were ei2723:spiked, he ei2724:said.\nei2725:Asked how the company ei2726:hopes to ei2727:expand its computer hardware business, Mr. Ousley ei2728:said it ei2729:sees good opportunities in systems integration. \"We ei2730:think we're ei2731:getting only 10% of the integration dollars our customers are ei2732:spending,\" he ei2733:said. \"We're in environments that are going to ei2734:spend a lot of money on that.\"\nControl Data mainframes are designed for numerically intensive computing users, such as the scientific, engineering and academic communities. Utilities management is a major commercial niche.\nei2735:Reviewing the company's ei2736:scrape with disaster, Mr. Price ei2737:conceded it had ei2738:tried to ei2739:do too much on its own. \"Absolutely,\" he said.\nBut while its stock is ei2740:selling at about half Control Data's estimated breakup value, neither Messrs. Perlman nor Price ei2741:said he ei2742:spends much time ei2743:considering the possibility of a hostile ei2744:takeover. \"We've been ei2745:listed as a candidate for so long it's not worth worrying about,\" ei2747:said Mr. Price.",

    "text": "Polly Peck International Inc.'s ei1990:agreement to ei1991:acquire 51% of Sansui Electric Co. proves that foreign companies can acquire Japanese companies -- if the alternative for the Japanese company is extinction.\nPolly Peck, a fast-growing British conglomerate, will ei1992:pay 15.6 billion yen ($110 million) for 39 million new shares of Sansui, a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that ei1993:failed to ei1994:adjust to changing market conditions. Japanese government officials, eager to ei1996:rebut foreign ei1997:criticism of Japanese ei1998:investments overseas, ei1999:hailed the ei2000:transaction as proof foreigners can make similar investments in Japan. Polly Peck's chairman, Asil Nadir, ei2001:echoed the official Japanese view of the ei2003:accord, which was ei2004:announced Friday.\n\"The myths that Japan is not open to concerns from outside has, I think, been ei2006:demolished at a stroke,\" Mr. Nadir ei2007:said.\nBut analysts ei2008:say Sansui is a special case. It ei2010:expects to ei2011:post a ei2012:loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently ei2013:exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen. \"If you ei2078:find sound, healthy companies in Japan, they are not for sale,\" ei2016:said George Watanabe, a management-consultant at Tokyo-based Asia Advisory Services Inc.\nStatistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail, because unlike Sansui, which is listed on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges, most of the Japanese companies e3000:acquired by foreigners are privately held. But by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of Japanese companies this year, while Japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies.\nNor do analysts ei2019:expect the Sansui deal to ei2020:touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases. If the strong yen and the high stock prices of Japanese companies weren't deterrents enough, webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes ei2021:repel most would-be acquirers.\nUsually when a Japanese company is ready to sell, it has few alternatives remaining, and the grim demeanors of Sansui's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company's finest hour. Sansui was once one of Japan's premier makers of expensive, high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles.\nBut in recent years, the market has ei2022:moved toward less expensive \"mini-component\" sets, miniaturized amplifiers and receivers and software players that could be stacked on top of each other.\nSome of Sansui's fellow audio-specialty companies, such as Aiwa Co. and Pioneer Electric Corp., ei2023:responded to the ei2024:challenge by quickly ei2025:bringing out mini-component products of their own, by ei2026:moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by ei2027:diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields, including laser disks or portable cassette players. Sansui was late into the mini-component business and ei2028:failed to ei2029:branch into other new businesses.\nAs the yen ei2030:soared in recent years, Sansui's deepening financial problems ei2031:became a vicious circle. While competitors ei2033:moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories, Sansui ei2035:lacked the money to ei2036:build new plants in Southeast Asia. \"Our company has not been ei2037:able to ei2038:cope very effectively with\" ei2039:changes in the marketplace, ei2040:said Ryosuke Ito, Sansui's president.\nBut even a Japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern, some management consultants maintain.\nYoshihisa Murasawa, a management consultant for Booz-Allen amp Hamilton (Japan) Inc., ei2041:said his firm will likely be ei2042:recommending ei2043:acquisitions of Japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future. \"Attitudes {toward being acquired} are still negative, but they're ei2044:becoming more positive,\" Mr. Murasawa ei2046:said. \"In some industries, like pharmaceuticals, acquisitions ei2081:make sense.\"\nWhether Polly Peck's ei2049:acquisition ei2080:makes sense ei2051:remains to be ei2052:seen, but at the news conference, Mr. Nadir ei2053:brimmed with self-confidence that he can ei2054:turn Sansui around. Sansui, he e3001:said, is a perfect fit for Polly Peck's electronics operations, which make televisions, videocassette recorders, microwaves and other products on an \"original equipment maker\" basis for sale under other companies' brand names.\nHe said Polly Peck will greatly ei2056:expand Sansui's product line, using Sansui's engineers to ei2058:design the new products, and will ei2059:move Sansui's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into Polly Peck's own factories.\n\"Whatever capital it (Sansui) needs so it can ei2060:compete and ei2061:become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world, that capital will be ei2062:injected,\" Mr. Nadir ei2063:said.\nAnd while Polly Peck isn't ei2064:jettisoning the existent top-management structure of Sansui, it is ei2065:bringing in a former Toshiba Corp. executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer.\nSuch risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash Mr. Nadir, who is 25% owner of Polly Peck as well as its chairman. He ei2066:took Polly Peck, once a small fabric wholesaler, and ei2067:used it at as a base to ei2068:build a conglomerate that has been ei2069:doubling its profits annually since 1980. In September, it ei2070:announced ei2071:plans to ei2072:acquire the tropical-fruit business of RJR Nabisco Inc.'s Del Monte foods unit for #557 million ($878 million).\nLast month, Polly Peck ei2073:posted a 38% ei2074:jump in pretax profit for the first half to #54.8 million from #39.8 million on a 63% ei2077:rise in sales.\nJoann S.

    "text": "The bolstered cellular agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN Broadcasting Corp. carries heightened risks and could ei2575:fail to ei2576:fend off McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the rival suitor for LIN.\nMoreover, the amended pact shows how McCaw's persistence has ei2578:pushed LIN and BellSouth into a corner, ei2579:forcing huge debt on the proposed new company. The debt, ei2580:estimated at $4.7 billion, could ei2582:mortgage the cellular company's future earning power in order to ei2583:placate some LIN holders in the short term.\nThe plan still ei2584:calls for LIN to ei2585:combine its cellular telephone properties with BellSouth's and to ei2586:spin off its broadcasting operations. But under new terms of the agreement, ei2588:announced Friday, LIN holders would ei2589:receive a special cash dividend of $42 a share, representing a payout of about $2.23 billion, shortly before the proposed ei2591:merger. LIN ei2592:said it ei2593:expects to ei2594:borrow the money to ei2595:pay the dividend, but ei2596:commitments from banks still haven't been ei2597:obtained. Under previous terms, holders would have ei2598:received a dividend of only $20 a share.\nIn addition, New York-based LIN would ei2599:exercise its right to ei2600:buy out for $1.9 billion the 55% equity interest of its partner, Metromedia Co., in a New York cellular franchise. That money also would have to be ei2602:borrowed. In effect, McCaw has ei2603:forced LIN's hand by ei2604:bidding $1.9 billion for the stake earlier this month.\n\"We're ei2605:taking on more debt than we would have ei2606:liked to,\" ei2607:acknowledged Michael Plouf, LIN's vice president and treasurer. Although he ei2608:expressed confidence that the proposed new company's cash flow would be ei2610:sufficient to ei2611:cover interest payments on the debt, he ei2612:estimated that the company wouldn't be ei2613:profitable until 1994 or later.\nAnalyst ei2614:estimate the value of the BellSouth proposal at about $115 to $125 a share. They ei2616:value McCaw's ei2617:bid at $112 to $118 a share. The previous BellSouth pact was ei2619:valued at about $98 to $110 a share.\nMcCaw, the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the U.S., already owns about 9.4% of LIN's stock. In response to BellSouth's amended pact, the Kirkland, Wash., company ei2621:extended its own ei2622:offer to ei2623:buy 22 million LIN shares for $125 apiece, which would ei2624:give McCaw a 50.3% controlling interest. Over the weekend, McCaw ei2625:continued to ei2626:call for an auction of LIN. Analysts ei2627:said they ei2628:expect McCaw to ei2629:escalate the bidding again.\n\"This game isn't over yet, \" ei2631:said Joel D. Gross, a vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin amp Jenrette Securities Corp. \"At some point, it will ei2632:become non-economical for one company. But I don't ei2634:think we're at that point yet.\"\nUnder its revised ei2637:proposal, Atlanta-based BellSouth would ei2638:have a 50% interest in the new cellular company and would be ei2639:responsible for half of its debt. To ei2640:sweeten the pact further -- and to ei2641:ease concerns of institutional investors -- BellSouth ei2643:added a provision designed to ei2644:give extra protection to holders if the regional Bell company ever ei2646:decides to ei2647:buy the rest of the new cellular company. The provision, described as \"back-end\" protection, would ei2648:require BellSouth to ei2649:pay a price equivalent to what an outside party might have to pay.\nMcCaw's bid also has a similar clause. Only McCaw's proposal ei2650:requires the company to ei2651:begin an auction ei2652:process in June 1994 for remaining shares at third-party prices.\nTo ei2653:mollify shareholders ei2654:concerned about the long-term value of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement, BellSouth also ei2657:agreed to ei2658:pay as much as $10 a share, or $540 million, if, after five years, the trading value of the new cellular company isn't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer.\n\"We're very ei2660:pleased with the new deal. We didn't ei2662:expect BellSouth to be so ei2663:responsive,\" ei2664:said Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc., which holds 500,000 LIN shares. BellSouth's \"back-end protection was flawed previously. We ei2665:think this is a superior deal to McCaw's. We're surprised. We didn't ei2667:think a sleeping {Bell} mentality would be ei2668:willing to ei2669:take on dilution.\"\nBut Kenneth Leon, a telecommunications analyst with Bear, Stearns amp Co., ei2670:finds the BellSouth proposal still ei2671:flawed because the company doesn't have to ei2703:wait five years to begin buying more LIN shares. \"How many shares will be around in 1995?\" he asked. \"There's nothing preventing BellSouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile.\"\nBellSouth's revised ei2672:proposal ei2673:surprised many industry analysts, especially because of the company's willingness to ei2675:accept some dilution of future earnings. William O. McCoy, president of the company's BellSouth Enterprises Inc. unit, ei2677:said the revised ei2678:agreement with LIN would ei2679:dilute BellSouth earnings by about 9% in both 1990 and 1991 and by significantly less thereafter. Indeed, BellSouth's cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable.\nFor 1988, BellSouth ei2680:earned $1.7 billion, or $3.51 a share, on revenue of $13.6 billion. Analysts were ei2681:predicting 1990 BellSouth earnings in the range of $3.90 a share, or $1.9 billion, but now those ei2683:estimates are being ei2684:scaled back.\nIn composite ei2685:trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, BellSouth shares ei2686:fell 87.5 cents to $52.125.\nIn national over-the-counter ei2688:trading, LIN shares ei2689:soared $4.625 to closed at $112.625, while McCaw ei2690:fell $2.50 a share to $37.75.\nThe proposed BellSouth-LIN cellular company, including the newly acquired Metromedia stake, would ei2692:give the new entity 55 million potential customers, including about 35 million in the nation's top 10 markets.\nMr. Leon of Bear Stearns ei2693:speculated that McCaw, in an ei2694:attempt to ei2695:buy time, might ei2696:consider ei2697:filing an antitrust suit against BellSouth with the Justice Department and U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that ei2698:broke up the Bell system in 1984.\nIndeed, McCaw ei2699:seemed to ei2700:hint at that option in a brief ei2701:statement. Urging LIN directors to conduct \"a fair auction on a level playing field,\" McCaw asked how well the public interest would be served \"with the Bell operating companies controlling over 94% of all cellular {potential customers} in the nation's top 10 markets.\"",

But the big, often tumultuous ei2015:slide in stock prices this month has ei2016:turned some of those who have been ei2017:profiting from the practice against it.\nPeter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, ei2019:acknowledges that he wasn't ei2020:troubled by program ei2021:trading when it ei2022:began in the pre-crash bull market because it ei2024:added liquidity and people were ei2025:pleased to ei2026:see stock prices ei2027:rising.\n\"We weren't as concerned until they ei2029:became sell programs,\" ei2030:says Mr. DaPuzzo, who now ei2031:thinks it ei2032:adds unnecessary volatility. Shearson Lehman, however, executes program trades for clients.\nMerrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Kidder Peabody, in addition to Shearson, do program-trade OTC stocks. Shearson, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs say they do so only for customers, however. Kidder Peabody does program trading for its own as well as clients' accounts.\nOf course, there were sell ei2033:programs in past years, too, but they ei2034:seem to ei2035:hurt market makers more painfully these days. That's largely because of defensive measures they ei2036:adopted after the 1987 ei2037:crash, when individual investors ei2038:fled the market and trading activity ei2039:dwindled. Market makers, to ei2040:cut costs, ei2041:slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders aren't selling.\nAnd to ei2042:protect their reduced capital investment from ei2043:eroding further, market makers became quicker to ei2044:lower price quotes when sell programs are ei2138:in progress. On days when prices are tumbling, they must be ei2046:willing to ei2047:buy shares from sellers when no one else will. In such an environment, market makers can ei2048:suffer huge ei2049:losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares.\n\"It ei2050:makes no ei2051:sense for us to ei2052:put money at risk when you ei2053:know you're going to lose,\" ei2055:says Mr. Antolini, of Donaldson Lufkin.\nBut this ei2056:skittishness, Mr. Antolini says, is ei2058:creating liquidity ei2059:problems in certain OTC stocks. \"It's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers don't want to { take the orders}. No one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks.\"\nJoseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees trading on Nasdaq, ei2060:agrees that program trading is ei2061:hurting the market's ei2062:efforts to ei2063:bring back small investors. But, he ei2064:observes, while makers ei2065:suffer ei2066:losses when program trading ei2067:drags the market down, they also ei2068:make money when program trading ei2069:pushes the prices higher. \"Sometimes {traders} ei2070:lose sight of that,\" he ei2071:says.\nThe OTC stocks in the SampP 500 include Nasdaq's biggest, such as Apple Computer, MCI Communications, Tele-Communications and Liz Claiborne. These big stocks greatly influence the Nasdaq Composite Index. When the computers say \"sell,\" the composite tumbles as well as the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\nThe problem, market makers say, is that while the industrial average and the SampP 500 usually recover as buy programs kick in, the Nasdaq Composite frequently is left behind.\nEight trading days after Oct. 12, the day before the stock market ei2072:plunge, for instance, the Nasdaq Composite had ei2073:fallen 4.3%, compared with 3.3% for the SampP 500, 3.5% for the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index and 3.6% for the industrial average. This gap eventually ei2074:closes, but slowly. Three days later, as of Friday's ei2075:close, the Nasdaq Composite was down 6%, compared with 5.9% for the industrial average, 5.7% for the SampP 500 and 5.8% for the Big Board Composite.\nThe main reason for this ei2077:lag is that individual investors ei2078:own 65% of the OTC market's capitalization, ei2079:according to Mr. Hardiman, much more than on the Big Board. Such investors tend to be more cautious than institutional investors are about re-entering the market after massive selloffs, market makers say.\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index ei2080:tumbled 5.39, or 1.2% to 452.76 on Friday. For the week, the index ei2082:dropped 3.8%.\nei2083:Weakness in big technology stocks ei2084:hurt the composite as well as the Nasdaq 100 Index, which ei2085:fell 1.4%, or 6.43, on Friday, to 437.68. The Nasdaq Financial Index ei2087:lost about 1%, or 3.95, to 448.80.\nFriday's trading volume ei2089:totaled 132.8 million shares. The average daily share turnover for October is almost 148 million shares.\nLIN Broadcasting ei2091:surged 4 5/8 to 112 5/8; LIN and BellSouth ei2092:sweetened their merger agreement in an ei2093:attempt to ei2094:keep shareholders from ei2095:tendering their shares to McCaw Cellular Communications. McCaw, which ei2096:dropped 2 1/2 to 37 3/4, has ei2097:offered $125 a share for a majority of LIN's shares.\nThe revised LIN-BellSouth agreement ei2099:boosts the dollar amount of the special dividend LIN promises to pay shareholders. LIN now ei2100:plans to ei2101:dole out $42 a share in cash, up from the earlier $20 amount.\nIntel ei2103:eased 1/8 to 31 7/8. The semiconductor concern ei2104:said the ei2105:interruption in ei2106:shipment of its 80486 computer chip will be ei2107:brief and ei2108:have little ei2109:impact on the company's earnings. The stock ei2110:fell 7/8 Thursday amid ei2111:concerns over problems discovered with the chip. Intel ei2113:told analysts that the company will ei2114:resume ei2115:shipments of the chips within two to three weeks.\nWeisfield's ei2116:rocketed 9 1/2 to 39 after the jewelry store operator ei2117:said it is in preliminary ei2136:discussions, with a party it wouldn't ei2119:identify, regarding the possible ei2120:acquisition of the company.\nStarpointe Savings Bank ei2121:rose 3 to 20 after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ei2122:approved Dime Savings Bank of New York's $21-a-share ei2123:acquisition of Starpointe.\nKirschner Medical ei2124:fell 4 to 15. The company ei2126:said its third-quarter earnings will probably be ei2127:lower than the 16 cents a share it ei2129:reported last year, despite a ei2130:rise in the company's revenue. Kirschner ei2131:earned $376,000 on revenue of $14.5 million in the 1988 quarter. The company ei2132:blamed a number of factors for the earnings ei2134:decline, including softer ei2135:sales of joint-implants.",

    "text": "London share prices ei1363:closed sharply lower Friday in active trading after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's ei1365:resignation ei1366:slapped the market and Wall Street's rapid initial sell-off ei1367:knocked it down.\nLondon shares were ei1368:depressed initially by overnight ei1369:losses in New York and by the ei1370:drop in sterling after Mr. Lawson's ei1371:resignation. It showed some early resilience after central bank support ei1374:firmed sterling, but the weight of Wall Street late in London trading, and signs of further weakness in the British pound, proved a hefty load to ei1377:bear. New York stocks ei1378:recovered some of their losses after the London market ei1379:closed.\nThe Financial Times 100-share index ei1380:shed 47.3 points to ei1381:close at 2082.1, down 4.5% from the previous Friday and 6.8% from Oct. 13, when Wall Street's ei1382:plunge ei1383:helped ei1384:spark the current ei1385:weakness in London.\nThe 30-share index ei1386:settled 42.0 points lower at 1678.5. Volume was 840.8 million shares, up from 443.6 million Thursday and the week's most active session.\nDealers ei1391:said the turnover, largely confined to the 100-share index stocks, partly ei1392:reflected the ei1393:flurry of activity typical at the ei1394:close of a two-week trading account and the ei1396:start of a new account. But they ei1398:said Friday's focus on the top-tier stocks ei1399:telegraphed active overseas ei1400:selling and ei1401:showed the broad-based fears over the status of the U.K. economy and Britain's currency in the wake of the ei1404:upheaval in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's cabinet.\nA senior dealer with Warburg Securities ei1405:noted British Gas, the most active blue-chip stock at 20 million shares traded, was ei1406:affected by the political implications of Mr. Lawson's ei1407:departure and Mrs. Thatcher's cabinet ei1408:shuffle.\nHe ei1409:attributed the unusually high volume to broad-based ei1411:selling on fears that the Thatcher government may be ei1528:in turmoil and Britain's Labor Party ei1414:positioned to ei1415:regain control of the government and ei1417:renew ei1418:efforts at ei1419:nationalization.\nBritish Gas ei1420:shed 8.5 pence a share to ei1421:close at 185 pence ($2.90).\nOther dealers ei1423:added that the blue-chip stocks in general were ei1424:hit by profit-taking over concerns that London shares will ei1426:continue ei1427:posting ei1428:declines and the uncertainty over sterling given that Mr. Lawson's successor, John Major, had only been in the job one day.\nBesides British Gas, British Steel ei1431:skidded 1.74 to 123.5 on turnover of 11 million shares.\nBritish Petroleum ei1433:fell 5 to 286 on 14 million shares traded. Dealers ei1435:said the multinational oil company was ei1436:pressured by recent brokerage recommendations ei1437:urging investors to ei1438:switch into Shell Trading amp Transport. Shell ei1439:eased 1 to 416 on turnover of 4.8 million shares.\nAmong the other actively traded blue-chip issues, Imperial Chemical Industries ei1441:dropped 11 to #10.86, Hanson ei1443:skidded 9.5 to 200.5, and British Telecom ei1445:fell 10 to 250.\nIn Tokyo, stocks ei1447:closed lower but above intraday lows in active trading. The Nikkei index was ei1449:pressured down by ei1451:profit-taking ei1452:triggered by sharp ei1453:advances made through this week and ei1454:fell 151.20 points to 35527.29.\nIn early ei1456:trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index ei1457:fell 148.85 points to 35378.44.\nOn Friday, the Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was down 15.82 at 2681.76. First-section volume was ei1460:estimated at 1.3 billion shares, up from 886 million shares Thursday.\nAn official at Wako Securities ei1463:said brokerages' excessive expectations about recent ei1465:advances in Tokyu Group shares and real estate issues were ei1466:dashed Friday.\nDealers ei1467:placed heavy buy orders in the morning to ei1469:start the first trading day for November ei1471:transactions. But they ei1472:failed to ei1473:sell these stocks to client investors, who were ei1474:cautious about the sharp ei1475:gains these issues ei1476:made this week, the Wako official ei1477:said.\nFund managers ei1478:said Friday's ei1479:profittaking was a natural ei1480:result of the week's \"abnormal fever\" in ei1482:buying real estate, shipbuilding, steel and construction shares.\nFrankfurt prices ei1483:closed lower again Friday, the fourth ei1485:decline in the past five days and the ei1486:culmination of a week that saw the DAX index ei1487:lose 4%. The DAX ei1488:dropped 19.69 points Friday to 1462.93.\nTraders ei1490:said the continued ei1491:turbulence in other markets, coupled with the ei1492:drop in London following the Lawson ei1493:resignation, were ei1494:responsible.\nTraders ei1495:said that selling pressure wasn't enormous and that the DAX ei1496:dropped Friday more on a lack of any substantial buying interest. They ei1498:said contributing to the downward ei1499:drift was the fact that many professional traders had ei1500:chosen to ei1501:square positions ahead of the weekend.\n\"It's the whole uncertainty about what's happening around us,\" e130:said Valentin Von Korff, a trader at Credit Suisse First Boston in Frankfurt.\n\"If you e131:take away the outside influences, the market itself looks very cheap. What's happening here isn't justified by the fundamentals.\"\nTraders said the market remains extremely nervous because of the wild swings seen on the New York Stock Exchange last week. That's leaving small investors with cold feet, they said, and prompting institutions to take a reserved stance on the sidelines as well, at least until the market in New York ei1510:settles down somewhat.\nElsewhere, share prices ei1511:closed lower in Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam, Brussels and Stockholm, and were ei1513:mixed in Milan. The British ei1514:shakeup was widely ei1515:cited for the ei1516:declines.\nShare prices also ei1517:closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, Manila, Wellington and Seoul. Concern about ei1520:declines in other markets, especially New York, ei1521:caused selling ei1523:pressure.\nHere are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as ei1524:calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage ei1525:change is since year-end.",

Kellogg's current share is ei2011:believed to be slightly under 40% while General Mills' share is about 27%.\nei2014:Led by its oat-based Cheerios line, General Mills has ei2015:gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of Kellogg. Each share point is worth about $60 million in sales.\nAnalysts ei2017:say much of Kellogg's ei2018:erosion has been in such core brands as Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Frosted Flakes, which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume. Kellogg is so ei2019:anxious to ei2020:turn around Corn Flakes sales that it soon will ei2021:begin ei2022:selling boxes for as little as 99 cents, trade sources ei2023:say.\n\"Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios have ei2024:eaten away sales normally ei2025:going to Kellogg's corn-based lines simply because they are ei2026:made of oats,\" ei2027:says Merrill Lynch food analyst William Maguire. \"They are not a ei2127:happy group of people at Battle Creek right now.\" Kellogg is based in Battle Creek, Mich., a city that calls itself the breakfast capital of the world.\nAnother analyst, John C. Maxwell Jr. of Wheat, First Securities in Richmond, Va., recently ei2137:went to a \"sell\" recommendation on Kellogg stock, which ei2031:closed Friday at $71.75, down 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. \"I don't ei2034:think Kellogg can ei2035:get back to 40% this year,\" he ei2037:said. \"Kellogg's main problem is life style. People are ei2038:reading the boxes and ei2039:deciding they ei2040:want something that's `healthy' for you -- oats, bran.\" Mr. Maxwell ei2042:said he wouldn't be ei2043:surprised if, over the next two years or so, General Mills' share ei2044:increased to 30% or more.\nIn ei2045:announcing the plant ei2046:delay, Kellogg Chairman William E. LaMothe ei2047:said, \"Cereal volume ei2048:growth in the U.S. has not ei2049:met our ei2050:expectations for 1989\". He ei2051:said ei2052:construction wouldn't ei2053:resume until market conditions ei2054:warrant it.\nKellogg ei2055:indicated that it ei2056:has room to ei2057:grow without ei2058:adding facilities. The company ei2059:has five other U.S. plants, including a modern facility at its Battle Creek headquarters known as Building 100, which is to ei2060:add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next year.\nGeneral Mills, meanwhile, finds itself ei2062:constrained from ei2063:boosting sales further because its plants are ei2064:operating at capacity. A large plant in Covington, Ga., is to ei2065:come on line next year.\nA Kellogg officer, who asked not to be named, ei2066:said the Memphis project was \" ei2067:pulled in for a ei2068:reconsideration of costs,\" an indication that the ambitious plans might be ei2069:scaled back in any future ei2070:construction. Initial cost estimates for the plant, which was to have been built in phases, ei2071:ranged from $1 billion to $1.2 billion.\nA company spokesman ei2072:said it was \"possible, but highly unlikely,\" that the plant might never be ei2073:built. \"As we ei2074:regain our leadership level where we have been, and as we ei2076:continue to ei2077:put new products into the marketplace and ei2078:need additional capacity, we will ei2080:look at ei2081:resuming our ei2082:involvement with our plan,\" he ei2083:said.\nThe new facility was to have been the world's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant, and Kellogg's largest construction project. The company had ei2086:retained the Fluor Daniel unit of Fluor Corp. as general contractor.\nBut in recent weeks, construction-industry sources ei2087:reported that early preparation work was ei2088:slowing at the 185-acre site. Subcontractors ei2089:said they were ei2090:told that equipment ei2091:orders would be ei2092:delayed. Fluor Daniel already has ei2093:reassigned most of its work crew, the sources ei2094:said.\nLast Friday's ei2095:announcement was the first official word that the project was ei2129:in trouble and that the company's plans for a surge in market share may have been overly ei2130:optimistic. Until recently, Kellogg had been ei2098:telling its sales force and Wall Street that by 1992 it ei2099:intended to ei2100:achieve a 50% share of market, measured in dollar volume.\nAlthough he ei2102:called current market conditions \"highly competitive,\" Mr. LaMothe, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer, ei2104:forecast an earnings ei2105:increase for the full year. Last year, the company ei2106:earned $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion.\nAs ei2107:expected, Kellogg ei2108:reported lower third-quarter earnings. Net ei2110:fell 16% to $123.1 million, or $1.02 a share, from $145.7 million, or $1.18 a share. Sales ei2113:rose 4.8% to $1.20 billion from $1.14 billion.\nThe company ei2116:had a one-time ei2117:charge of $14.8 million in the latest quarter covering the ei2118:disposition of certain assets. The company wouldn't ei2119:elaborate, ei2120:citing competitive reasons.",

The No. 1 U.S. auto maker then ei2462:wrote Jaguar that it ei2463:intends \"to ei2464:go to that 15%\" level once it ei2466:wins the U.S. ei2467:clearance to ei2468:go beyond $15 million, a Jaguar spokesman ei2470:said yesterday.\nThe GM ei2471:move follows Tuesday's ei2472:declaration by Ford, which holds an unwelcome 12.45% stake in Jaguar, that it is ei2473:prepared to ei2474:bid for the entire company. GM is close to ei2475:completing a friendly ei2476:deal with Jaguar that is likely to ei2477:involve an eventual 30% stake and joint manufacturing ventures. Speculative investors, ei2479:betting on an imminent ei2480:clash between Ford and GM, ei2481:pushed up Jaguar's share price five pence (eight U.S. cents) to a near-record 720 pence ($11.60) in late ei2484:trading on London's stock exchange yesterday. Since Tuesday, the shares have ei2485:gained nearly 4%.\nBut an all-out bidding ei2486:war between the world's top auto giants for Britain's leading luxury-car maker seems unlikely. \"We will not ei2487:go over a certain level,\" ei2488:said David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president for finance, at a news ei2489:conference yesterday in Dearborn, Mich. \"There's some price at which we'd ei2490:stop ei2491:bidding.\" He wouldn't ei2492:specify what it was.\nAnd powerful political ei2493:pressures may ei2494:convince the Conservative government to ei2495:keep its so-called golden share, which limits any individual holding to 15%, until the restriction ei2497:expires on Dec. 31, 1990.\n\"I really don't ei2498:see the government ei2499:doing something that Jaguar doesn't ei2500:want over the next 14 months,\" ei2501:said Kenneth Warren, a Conservative member of Parliament and chairman of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry in Britain's House of Commons. \"The golden share is a single share, but it is the magic share.\"\nThe government ei2502:retained the single share after ei2503:selling its stake in Jaguar in 1984 -- part of a nationalistic practice of protecting former government-owned enterprises to deflect criticism of privatization. The 15% restriction covers any would-be suitor, British or foreign.\nFord is ei2504:willing to ei2505:bid for 100% of Jaguar's shares if both the government and Jaguar shareholders ei2506:agree to ei2507:relax the anti-takeover barrier prematurely. As Jaguar's biggest holder and Britain's biggest car maker, Ford could ei2508:turn up the heat by ei2509:convening a special shareholders' ei2510:meeting and ei2511:urging holders to ei2512:drop the limits early. Ford might ei2513:succeed because many shareholders are speculators ei2514:keen for a full ei2515:bid or institutional investors ei2516:unhappy over Jaguar management's ei2517:handling of its current financial ei2518:difficulties.\nThe government probably wouldn't ei2519:give in readily to a hostile foray by Ford, however. It has ei2520:relinquished a golden share only once before -- during British Petroleum Co.'s #2.5 billion ( $4 billion ) ei2521:takeover of Britoil PLC in 1988.\nIn ei2522:wooing British lawmakers, GM has ei2523:pointed out that its willingness to ei2525:settle for a minority stake would ei2526:keep Jaguar ei2527:British-owned and ei2528:independent. This week, the U.S. auto giant ei2529:paid for 10 House of Commons members and two House of Lords members to ei2530:fly to Detroit and ei2531:tour its operations there. While the ei2532:visit was unrelated to Jaguar, GM Chairman Roger Smith ei2533:answered the legislators' ei2534:questions about it over ei2535:lunch Tuesday. He ei2536:said Jaguar \"shouldn't be ei2537:smothered by anyone else, \" ei2538:recalled one participant.\nPolitics also influences the government's thinking on the anti-takeover restriction. The Conservatives don't dare jeopardize marginal Tory seats in Coventry, where Jaguar has headquarters, nor can the government easily back down on promised protection for a privatized company while it proceeds with controversial plans to privatize most of Britain's water and electricity industries.\nPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher might, however, be ei2539:receptive to any ei2540:request by Jaguar Chairman Sir John Egan for the restriction's early ei2541:removal to let GM ei2543:amass more than 15% or ei2544:mount a friendly suitor ei2545:bid against Ford.

    "text": "Billions of investors' dollars are ei2578:pouring out of the nation's junk-bond mutual funds, ei2579:undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market.\nLast week alone, an eye-popping $1.6 billion ei2580:flowed out of the junk funds, or nearly 5% of their total assets, ei2581:according to estimates by Dalbar Financial Services Inc., a Boston research firm.\nIn the past two months the nation's 88 junk funds have ei2582:lost a total of about $6 billion -- more than 15% of assets -- through ei2583:sales or ei2584:transfers of junk-fund shares, Dalbar ei2585:says. It made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds.\nei2586:Interviews with three major fund groups -- Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group Inc. and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. -- ei2587:confirm the ei2588:trend. Their junk funds combined have had net ei2589:outflows totaling nearly $500 million, or about 13% of their junk fund assets, in the past two months.\nSome fund managers ei2590:say negative publicity has ei2591:exacerbated investors' concern about recent ei2592:declines in junk-bond prices. \"People have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying: `I can't take it anymore -- I'm getting out,'\" ei2593:says Kurt Brouwer of Brouwer amp Janachowski, a San Francisco investment adviser.\nThe ei2594:withdrawals could ei2595:spell trouble for the $200 billion junk market. If the heavy ei2597:outflows ei2598:continue, fund managers will ei2599:face increasing ei2600:pressure to ei2601:sell off some of their junk to ei2602:pay departing investors in the weeks ahead. Such ei2603:selling could ei2604:erode prices of high-yield junk bonds, already ei2605:weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems.\nMutual fund groups haven't ei2607:lost control of much of the outgoing money, ei2608:says Louis Harvey, Dalbar's president. Mutual fund officials ei2609:say that investors have ei2610:transferred most of it into their money market accounts, and to a lesser extent, government-bond funds. So the ei2611:impact on the $950 billion mutual fund industry as a whole probably will be slight.\nBut tremors are likely in the junk-bond market, which has ei2612:helped to ei2613:finance the takeover ei2614:boom of recent years. Mutual funds are the among the largest holders of junk, accounting for more than a quarter of the entire high-yield, high-risk market. The 88 mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $32 billion. Other funds hold a smattering of junk bonds, too.\nThe $1.5 billion Fidelity High Income Fund has had a net ei2615:outflow of about $150 million in the past two months. About $60 million ei2616:streamed out last week alone, double the level of the week following last month's Campeau Corp. credit ei2619:squeeze. About 98% of the outflow was ei2620:transferred to other Fidelity funds, ei2621:says Neal Litvack, a Fidelity vice president, marketing, with most ei2622:going into money market funds.\n\"You get a news item, it hits, you have strong e3000:redemptions that day and for two days following -- then go back to normal,\" ei2623:says Mr. Litvack. The fund, with a cash cushion of more than 10%, has \" met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing,\" Mr. Litvack says. He ei2627:adds: \"Our fund has had {positive} net ei2628:sales every month for the last three years -- until this month.\"\nVanguard's $1 billion High Yield Bond Portfolio has ei2629:seen $161 million ei2630:flow out since early September; $14 million of that ei2631:seeped out Friday Oct. 13 alone. Still, two-thirds of the ei2632:outflow has been ei2633:steered into other Vanguard portfolios, ei2634:says Brian Mattes, a vice president. The fund now ei2635:holds a cash position of about 15%.\nAt the $932 million T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund, investors ei2636:yanked out about $182 million in the past two months. Those ei2637:withdrawals, most of which were ei2638:transferred to other T. Rowe Price funds, followed little ei2639:change in the fund's sales picture this year through August. \"The last two months have been the whole ball ei2640:game,\" ei2641:says Steven Norwitz, a vice president.\nJunk-fund holders have barely ei2642:broken even this year, as fat interest payments barely ei2643:managed to offset declining prices. Through Oct. 19, high-yield funds ei2644:had an average 0.85% total return (the price change plus dividends on fund shares), ei2645:according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. That's even less than the 4.35% total return of the Merrill Lynch High-Yield Index.\nFidelity's junk fund has ei2646:fallen 2.08% this year through Oct. 19, Lipper ei2647:says; the Vanguard fund ei2648:rose 1.84%; and the T. Rowe Price fund ei2649:edged up 0.66%.\nPeople who ei2650:remain in junk funds now could ei2651:get ei2652:hit again, some analysts and fund specialists ei2653:say. Many funds in recent weeks and months have been ei2654:selling their highest-quality junk issues, such as RJR Nabisco, to ei2655:raise cash to ei2657:meet expected ei2659:redemptions.\nFunds might be ei2660:forced to ei2661:accept lower prices if they ei2663:expand their ei2664:selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers. And then, asset values of the funds could ei2665:plunge more than they have so far.\nSays Michael Hirsch, chief investment officer of Republic National Bank and manager of the FundTrust Group in New York: \"It's a time bomb just waiting to go off.\"",

And defense lawyers are ei1992:warning that they won't ei1993:stick around if they don't get ei1994:paid.\nThe issue has come to a boil in Newark, N.J., where federal prosecutors have ei1995:warned lawyers for Eddie Antar that if the founder and former chairman of Crazy Eddie Inc. is ei1996:indicted, the government may ei1997:move to ei1998:seize the money that Mr. Antar is ei1999:using to ei2000:pay legal fees.\nThe ei2001:warning by the U.S. attorney's office follows two ei2002:decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court last June. In those cases, the high court ei2003:ruled that federal law ei2004:gives prosecutors broad authority to ei2006:seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes, including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment.\nIf the government ei2007:succeeds in ei2008:seizing Mr. Antar's assets, he could be ei2009:left without top-flight legal representation, because his attorneys are likely to ei2010:quit, ei2011:according to individuals familiar with the case. A ei2012:seizure also would ei2013:make the case the largest -- and one of the first -- in which lawyers' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs.\n\"The people who suffer in the short run are defendants, but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people, because there won't be a vigorous private bar to defend the Bill of Rights,\" ei2015:says Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defense attorney who ei2016:says he has ei2017:turned down a number of cases to ei2018:avoid possible fee ei2019:seizures.\nMr. Antar is being ei2020:investigated by a federal grand jury in Newark, where prosecutors have ei2021:told him that they may soon ei2022:seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges. Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, the government ei2024:has the authority to ei2025:seek to ei2026:freeze or ei2027:seize a defendant's assets before ei2028:trial.\nei2029:According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar's case, prosecutors ei2030:issued their warning this week after one of Mr. Antar's attorneys ei2031:asked whether legal fees might be ei2032:subject to ei2033:seizure. In a letter, prosecutors ei2034:told Mr. Antar's lawyers that because of the recent Supreme Court ei2035:rulings, they could ei2036:expect that any fees collected from Mr. Antar may be ei2037:seized. Prosecutors have ei2038:told Mr. Antar's attorneys that they ei2039:believe Mr. Antar's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys ei2040:derives from illegal ei2041:activities. Therefore, they ei2042:said, the money can be ei2043:taken from the lawyers even after they are ei2044:paid.\nJustin Feldman and Jack Arseneault, attorneys for Mr. Antar, both ei2045:declined to ei2046:comment on the matter.\nIn Newark, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito ei2047:said, \"I don't ei2048:think there's any legal reason to ei2050:limit forfeiture of attorney's fees to drug cases.\" Mr. Alito ei2052:said his office \"just ei2053:responded to an attorney's question about whether we would ei2055:go after attorney's fees, and that is different from actually doing it, although we ei2056:reserve that right.\"\nMr. Antar was ei2058:charged last month in a civil suit ei2060:filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In that suit, the SEC ei2062:accused Mr. Antar of ei2063:engaging in a \"massive financial ei2064:fraud\" to ei2065:overstate the earnings of Crazy Eddie, Edison, N.J., over a three-year period. Through his lawyers, Mr. Antar has ei2066:denied ei2067:allegations in the SEC suit and in civil suits previously ei2070:filed by shareholders against Mr. Antar and others.\nThe SEC has ei2071:alleged that Mr. Antar ei2072:aimed to ei2073:pump up the company's stock price through false financial statements in order to ei2075:sell his stake and ei2076:reap huge profits. Mr. Antar, the SEC ei2077:said, ei2078:made more than $60 million from the ei2079:sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987.\nThe Justice Department has ei2080:emphasized that the government's fee-forfeiture power is to be ei2081:used sparingly. ei2082:According to department policy, prosecutors must make a strong ei2083:showing that lawyers' fees ei2084:came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any ei2085:attempts at ei2086:seizure are ei2087:made.\nStill, criminal defense lawyers ei2088:worry that defendants are being ei2089:deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair ei2091:trial if the government can ei2092:seize lawyers' fees. They also ei2093:worry that if the government ei2094:applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly, the best defense lawyers will be ei2095:unwilling to ei2096:take criminal cases unless they are ei2097:assured of being ei2098:paid.",

Hewlett ei2241:announced last week that it ei2242:planned to ei2243:ship a computer based on the 486 chip early next year. \"These bugs don't ei2244:affect our schedule at all,\" he ei2245:said.\nLikewise, AST Research Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. ei2246:said the bugs won't ei2247:delay their ei2248:development of 486-based machines. \"We haven't ei2249:modified our schedules in any way,\" ei2250:said a Sun spokesman. To ei2251:switch to another vendor's chips, \"would not definitely be an option,\" he ei2253:said.\nNonetheless, concern about the chip may have been responsible for a ei2256:decline of 87.5 cents in Intel's stock to $32 a share yesterday in over-the-counter ei2258:trading, on volume of 3,609,800 shares, and partly responsible for a ei2260:drop in Compaq's stock in New York Stock Exchange composite ei2261:trading on Wednesday. Yesterday, Compaq ei2262:plunged further, ei2263:closing at $100 a share, off $8.625 a share, on volume of 2,633,700 shares.\nMost of Compaq's ei2265:decline is being ei2266:attributed to a third-quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts' expectations.\nIntel ei2268:said it had ei2269:corrected the problems and would ei2271:start ei2272:producing bugless chips next week. \"We should not be ei2273:seeing any more,\" ei2274:said Bill Rash, Intel's director for the 486 chip.\nWhat's more, the bugs only ei2275:emerge on esoteric applications such as computer-aided design and scientific calculations, he ei2276:said, and then very seldom. \"These errata do not ei2277:affect business programs,\" he ei2278:said. The bugs will ei2279:cause problems in \"specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications\" such as word-processing and spreadsheets, ei2281:said Michael Slater, editor of the Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter.\nSun, Hewlett-Packard and others ei2282:say Intel isn't wholly to blame for the snafu. The real culprits, they ei2283:said, are computer makers such as IBM that have ei2284:jumped the gun to ei2285:unveil 486-based products. \"The reason this is getting so much visibility is that some ei2286:started ei2287:shipping and ei2288:announced early availability,\" ei2290:said Hewlett-Packard's Mr. Archuleta. \"You can do that but you're taking a risk. Those companies are paying the price for taking the risk.\"\nIn late September, IBM ei2291:began ei2292:shipping a plug-in card that converts its PS/2 model 70-A21 from a 80386 machine to an 80486 machine. An IBM spokeswoman ei2293:said the company ei2294:told customers Monday about the bugs and temporarily ei2296:stopped ei2297:shipping the product.\nIBM ei2298:has no plans to ei2299:recall its add-on cards, the spokeswoman ei2300:said, and could probably ei2301:circumvent the bugs without long product ei2302:delays. \"We don't ei2303:look at this as a major problem for us,\" she ei2304:said.\nCompaq, which ei2305:said it ei2306:discovered the bugs, still ei2307:plans to ei2308:announce new 486 products on Nov. 6. Because of the glitch, however, the company ei2310:said it doesn't ei2311:know when its machine will be commercially ei2312:available. That's a break from Compaq tradition, because the company doesn't announce products until they're actually at the dealers.\nThe problem is being ei2313:ballyhooed, experts ei2314:say, because the 486 is Intel's future flagship. Intel's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today's personal computers and the 80486 microprocessor is the spearhead of the company's bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines.\n\"Although these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon, the 486 is an extremely high-profile product,\" ei2316:said Mr. Slater, the newsletter editor.\nIntel's 80486 chip is the Corvette of Intel's microprocessors, a super-fast, super-expensive chip that only the most power-hungry computer users are likely to buy for at least several years.\nUnveiled last April, the chip crams 1.2 million transistors on a sliver of silicon, more than four times as many as on Intel's earlier model, 80386. Intel clocks the chip's speed at 15 million instructions per second, or MIPs. That's four times as fast as the 386.\nMachines ei2318:using the 486 are ei2319:expected to ei2320:challenge higher-priced work stations and minicomputers in applications such as so-called servers, which connect groups of computers together, and in computer-aided design.\nBut while the chip's speed in processing power is dazzling, it's real strength lies in its software inheritance. The 486 is the descendant of a long series of Intel chips that ei2321:began ei2322:dominating the market ever since IBM ei2323:picked the 16-bit 8088 chip for its first personal computer. (A 16-bit microprocessor processes 16 pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer, 32-bit chips.) Since then, Intel has ei2324:cornered a large part of the market with successive generations of 16-bit and 32-bit chips, all of which can run software written for previous models.\nThat's what will ei2325:keep computer makers ei2326:coming in spite of the irritation of bugs. Big personal computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are ei2327:developing 486-based machines, which are ei2328:expected to ei2329:reach the market early next year.\nOf the big computer makers, only Apple Computer Co. bases its machines on Motorola chips instead. \"The 486 is going to ei2330:have a big ei2331:impact on the industry,\" ei2332:said Hewlett-Packard's Mr. Archuleta. \"It's going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for the next few years. This bug is not going to ei2334:have any affect on that at all.\"\nAndy Zipser in Dallas contributed to this article.",

Financiere de Paribas to ei2648:bring its stake in Navigation Mixte to 66.7%.\nAt a news ei2650:conference, Mr. Fournier ei2651:accused Paribas of ei2652:planning to ei2653:pay for the ei2654:takeover by selling parts of the company, whose interests include insurance, banking, tuna canning, sugar and orange juice.\nThe chairman ei2656:said his board members, including representatives of West German insurance giant Allianz AG and French banks Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale, ei2657:hold nearly 50% of Navigation Mixte's capital.\nMr. Fournier ei2658:said that as Navigation Mixte chairman, he is ei2659:prohibited by takeover regulations from ei2660:organizing his own defense or ei2661:doing anything besides ei2662:managing current company business. But sources ei2663:said he will be ei2664:urging his allies to ei2665:boost their stakes in Navigation Mixte, which is being ei2666:traded in London and is to ei2667:resume ei2668:trading in Paris Tuesday. At the same time, he is ei2669:expected to ei2670:seek legal and regulatory means of ei2671:blocking or ei2672:delaying Paribas's ei2673:bid. For the moment, the sources ei2674:said, he has ei2675:decided against ei2676:seeking a white knight or ei2677:organizing a ei2678:counterbid for Paribas.\nMr. Fournier ei2679:said Navigation Mixte's 1989 unconsolidated, or parent-company, profit is likely to be 4.7 billion francs ($754.4 million), up from 633.8 million francs last year. That is due mostly to ei2682:payments from Allianz for most of the 50% stake it has ei2683:agreed to ei2684:acquire in Navigation Mixte's insurance business. Mr. Fournier ei2685:said the exceptional gain would ei2758:mean nearly twice as high a dividend this year as last. If holders ei2688:avoid ei2689:tendering to Paribas, he ei2690:added, they can ei2691:expect strong dividends again next year.\nAnalysts ei2693:noted that over the past 20 years, Mr. Fournier has ei2694:built his company through astute stock-market activity and has ei2696:warded off at least three takeover ei2698:attempts. This time, however, some analysts ei2699:think he could ei2700:face a real ei2701:battle.\n\"Without some unexpected \"coup de theatre\", I don't ei2703:see what will ei2704:block the Paribas ei2705:bid,\" ei2706:said Philippe de Cholet, analyst at the brokerage Cholet-Dupont amp Cie. Mr. de Cholet ei2707:said Mr. Fournier's biggest hope was to somehow ei2709:persuade regulatory authorities to ei2710:block the ei2711:bid. Paribas still needs the go-ahead from the Commission des Operations de Bourse, a government regulatory agency, but analysts ei2712:said that is considered likely.\nMr. Fournier also ei2714:noted that Navigation Mixte ei2715:joined Paribas's core of shareholders when Paribas was ei2716:denationalized in 1987, and ei2717:said it now ei2718:holds just under 5% of Paribas's shares. Once he ei2719:realized that Paribas's intentions weren't friendly, he ei2721:said, but before the ei2722:bid was ei2723:launched, he ei2724:sought ei2725:approval to ei2726:boost his Paribas stake above 10%. The petition is still ei2728:pending, but Mr. Fournier ei2729:downplayed the likelihood of his ei2730:organizing a takeover ei2731:bid of his own for the much-larger Paribas.\nOne big question now is the likely role of Mr. Fournier's allies. Mr. Fournier ei2732:said the large institutions that hold nearly 50% of Navigation Mixte's capital all strongly ei2733:support him, but some analysts ei2734:said they aren't so sure.

The profit gain was ei2002:made despite a ei2003:weakening in the housing market, for which the company is a supplier, and a ei2004:strengthening in the dollar, which ei2005:lowers the value of overseas earnings when they are translated into dollars.\nThe Wilmington, Del., company ei2006:reported net of $547 million, or $2.36 a share, which was in line with Wall Street ei2008:estimates.

He ei2043:said Du Pont ei2044:holds about 23% of the world-wide market, the largest single share, at a time when growing uses for the pigment have kept it in tight supply, although others are now adding low-cost production capacity.\nProfit ei2045:climbed to $98 million from $71 million in the petroleum segment, as Du Pont's Conoco Inc. oil company was ei2048:helped by crude oil prices higher than a year ago and by higher natural gas prices and volume.\nIn the diversifed businesses segment, which includes herbicides, profit ei2051:grew to $64 million from $27 million. A spokesman ei2054:said herbicide ei2055:use in some areas of the U.S. was ei2056:delayed earlier in the year by heavy ei2057:rains, thus ei2058:increasing sales in the third quarter.\nIn the fibers segment, profit ei2059:rose to $180 million from $155 million, a gain Du Pont ei2062:attributed to higher ei2063:demand in the U.S. for most textile products.\nTwo segments ei2064:posted lower ei2065:earnings for the quarter. Profit from coal ei2066:fell to $41 million from $58 million, partly because of a miners' ei2069:strike.

The directors ei770:added that the two executives haven't ei771:reached a final ei772:decision to ei773:proceed with a ei774:bid and that until an ei775:offer is ei776:made the board will ei777:continue ei778:seeking higher offers from other bidders.\nThe directors ei779:said if Messrs.

MCA holds half of Cineplex's equity and 33% of its voting rights through restricted voting shares, while Bronfman interests hold about 24% of the company's equity.\nMs. Kolber ei794:said the committee had ei795:received other bids. She ei796:declined to ei797:identify other bidders but ei798:said Mr. Drabinsky's offer \"is all cash, and it's for all of the company.\" Several Cineplex analysts have ei800:speculated that outside bids received by the committee were either disappointingly ei860:low or for only part of the company.\n\"All this has really established is that MCA and the Bronfmans have ei803:agreed on a price at which they can be ei804:bought out,\" ei805:said Jeffery Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon in Los Angeles. \"If a bid ei806:materializes at that price, shareholders will have every reason to be ei807:glad, but the question of financing still ei808:remains.\"\nLast April, Mr. Drabinsky and a group of financial backers ei809:planned to ei810:acquire up to 30.2% of Cineplex for C$17.50 a share from Bronfman associates. Mr. Drabinsky, who would have ei811:had the right to ei813:vote those shares for two years, ei814:said the ei815:purchase, subsequently ei816:rejected by regulators, was ei817:aimed at ei818:consolidating his control of the company. MCA strongly ei820:opposed the Drabinsky group's move.\nThe directors didn't ei821:indicate the source of financing for Mr. Drabinsky's new proposal, but ei822:said MCA and the Bronfman associates ei823:agreed in principle to ei824:buy for $57 million and then ei825:lease back to Cineplex its 18-screen theater complex in Universal City, Calif., if Mr. Drabinsky ei826:succeeds in an offer.\n\"This is being ei827:done at the ei828:suggestion of {Mr. Drabinsky} and to ei829:accommodate him, to ei830:facilitate his financing ei831:arrangements,\" Ms. Kolber ei832:said.\nIn addition, the directors ei833:said if a bid by Mr. Drabinsky is ei834:successful, Cineplex ei835:expects Rank Organisation PLC to ei836:acquire the 51% of Cineplex's Film House unit it doesn't ei837:own, and ei838:provide Mr. Drabinsky with additional loan financing.\nMichael Gifford, Rank's chief executive, ei839:said the British theater chain's total involvement \"wouldn't ei840:exceed $100 million\" but ei841:declined to ei842:give a breakdown between the loan financing and the proposed Film House purchase.\nCineplex shareholders ei843:responded coolly to yesterday's ei844:announcement.

Mr. Panet-Raymond ei850:said he doesn't ei851:think Messrs.

Earnings for GM common stock, reflecting the performance of GM's core automotive ei2000:operations, will be ei2001:disclosed this morning. GM Class H, which represents a dividend interest in Hughes earnings, ei2002:closed at $29, up 25 cents in Big Board composite trading. GM Class E, which represents a dividend interest in EDS profit, ei2004:fell 75 cents to $52.25 on the Big Board.\nThe earnings ei2006:drop at GM Hughes Electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of Hughes Aircraft Co. and GM's North American automotive operations, which are a primary customer for the Delco Electronics Corp. side of the GM Hughes unit.\nProfit at the unit ei2007:fell to $110.6 million, or 37 cents a share, from $142.4 million, or 45 cents a share, largely because of a $24 million one-time ei2010:charge associated with Hughes's previously ei2011:announced ei2012:plan to ei2013:reduce employment by at least 6,000 people by year end.

Revenue ei2025:rose 3.5% to $8.47 billion from $8.18 billion.\nAt GMAC, net ei2028:dropped 3.1% to $234.5 million from $241.9 million. The finance unit ei2031:attributed the ei2032:decline to higher borrowing costs compared with a year earlier. GMAC ei2035:said its automotive financing and leasing business ei2036:rose 35% in the U.S., largely because of dealer and customer incentives ei2037:used to ei2038:boost sales.

Marous, chairman and chief executive officer, also ei1995:said the company ei1996:expects sales from continuing businesses to ei1997:rise 8.5% annually through the next three years.\nIn 1988, the company ei1998:earned $822.8 million, or $5.66 a share, on sales of $12.49 billion.\nSince 1983, Westinghouse has ei1999:shed 70 businesses that it didn't ei2000:expect to ei2001:produce 10% operating margins while ei2002:acquiring 55 businesses.\nIn the past 20 months alone, Paul E. Lego, president and chief operating officer, ei2003:said the divestiture of $300 million of slow-growth, low-profit businesses has been more than ei2058:offset by $600 million in profitable acquisitions.\nWestinghouse ei2005:expects to ei2006:meet its corporate goals despite a softening in the economy. Even if the gross national product is either flat or in the growth range of 2% to 2.5%, \"we can ei2009:handle that,\" Mr. Marous ei2010:said. GNP is the total value of the nation's output of goods and services.\nA bright spot is the company's power-generation business, which is ei2011:experiencing a surge of ei2012:growth for the first time in years. Mr. Marous ei2013:said the business will ei2014:achieve higher sales this year than the company's target goal of 8.5%.\nWhile Westinghouse hasn't ei2015:had a nuclear power plant order from a U.S. utility in about a decade, excess capacity is ei2017:beginning to ei2018:shrink. Mr. Lego ei2019:said the company ei2020:foresees the need for a major ei2022:boost in new-generation capability throughout the 1990s.\nWestinghouse also is well ei2023:positioned to ei2024:sell steam turbine and gas turbine plants to independent power producers. The company's ability to respond to energy needs world-wide will be ei2025:enhanced through a recently announced ei2027:venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mr. Lego ei2028:said.\nHe ei2029:said the independent power segment could ei2030:grow to ei2031:provide as much as 50% of near-term generation capacity, ei2032:adding: \"We ei2033:expect to ei2034:supply a significant share of this market.\"\nWestinghouse also ei2035:expects its international sales to soon ei2036:grow to 25% of total corporate sales from 20% last year. The company is ei2039:negotiating with the Soviets to ei2040:build a Thermo King truck-refrigeration plant that would ei2041:produce about 10,000 units annually.\nMr. Marous ei2042:said Westinghouse would ei2043:own 70% of the facility. The ei2044:deal, which will ei2045:involve an initial $20 million ei2046:investment, was ei2047:struck with a ei2048:handshake, he ei2049:added.\nCompany officials also ei2050:said that any gain from the ei2051:sale of Westinghouse's 55% stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the Swiss firm of Asea Brown Boveri will be ei2052:offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. The executives didn't ei2053:disclose the size of the expected gain.\nCapital expenditure in 1990 will ei2054:rise slightly, Mr. Marous ei2055:said, from an estimated $470 million this year.",

In fact, he ei945:thinks several steelmakers will ei946:report actual ei947:losses through the third quarter of 1990.\nBethlehem, the nation's second largest steelmaker, ei948:earned $46.9 million, or 54 cents a share. The figures ei949:include $15 million in costs related to a blast furnace ei950:outage and $8 million in losses from unauthorized work ei952:outages at the company's coal operations.

The company ei982:said its shipments ei983:declined as a result of a ei984:reduction in inventories by service centers, a lackluster automotive market and ei985:increasing competitive pressures in the construction market.\nAt the same time, production costs, compared with a year ago, were ei986:boosted by higher raw material and employment costs, which ei987:resulted from the company's new labor ei988:pact effective June 1.\n\"We ei990:anticipate that steel market conditions will ei991:exhibit a further moderate ei992:decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive sector ei993:remains weak and customers ei994:continue to ei995:adjust inventories,\" ei996:said Bethlehem Chairman Walter F. Williams. He ei997:noted, however, that the company's order entry has ei998:increased from the low levels of the early summer, ei999:following the end of labor ei1000:negotiations.\nSteel business, ei1001:said third-quarter net income ei1002:dropped 8% to $33 million, or 35 cents a share, from $36 million, or 39 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. Sales ei1005:dropped to $441.1 million from $820.4 million, because the company no longer ei1008:consolidates its Eastern Steel division, which is now a joint ei1009:venture with Kawasaki Steel Corp.\nAlong with reduced volume, analysts ei1011:said the nation's fifth largest steelmaker was ei1012:hurt by ei1013:holding higher-cost inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel ei1014:dropped. Operating profit ei1015:dropped 46% in its specialty flat-rolled steel segment. Moreover, the company ei1016:said higher sales and shipments to service centers from its Armco Steel Co. joint venture ei1017:failed to ei1018:offset weakness in the automotive market, higher production costs and a poorer product mix.\nArmco shares ei1019:closed unchanged at $10.625 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nNational Intergroup, which ei1021:owns 50% of the nation's sixth largest steelmaker -- National Steel Corp. -- ei1022:posted net income for the fiscal second-quarter of $8.6 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $50.3 million. Sales ei1024:increased in the quarter ei1025:ended Sept. 30 to $747.8 million from $623.5 million a year ago. The latest period ei1028:includes gains of $9.1 million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry-forward. Last year's results were ei1032:hurt by $41.3 million in restructuring charges.\nNational Intergroup stock ei1034:closed at $15, unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe company ei1036:noted that its Fox-Meyer Drug Co., Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and Permian Corp. operations ei1037:showed ei1038:improvements as a result of restructuring ei1040:moves. However, its equity in the net income of National Steel ei1041:declined to $6.3 million from $10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor ei1048:talks and a ei1049:threatened ei1050:strike.

Mr. Lortie's ei2027:departure, while sudden, was ei2028:seen as ei2029:inevitable in light of the ei2030:shift in strategy. \"The non-food operations were largely Mr. Lortie's creation {and} his strategy didn't ei2031:work,\" ei2032:said Steven Holt, a financial analyst with Midland Doherty Ltd.\nProvigo's profit record over the past two years ei2033:tarnished the company's and Mr. Lortie's reputations. For the six months ei2034:ended Aug. 12, Provigo ei2035:posted net income of C$6.5 million, or eight Canadian cents a share, compared with C$18.1 million, or 21 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier. Sales were C$4.2 billion compared with C$3.7 billion. Last month, Canadian Bond Rating Service ei2040:downgraded Provigo's commercial paper and debentures because of its lackluster ei2041:performance.\nAnalysts are ei2042:skeptical Provigo will be able to ei2043:sell the non-food businesses as a group for at least book value, and are ei2044:expecting ei2045:write-downs. Mr. Nadeau ei2046:said he couldn't yet ei2047:say if the sale prices would ei2048:match book values. He ei2049:said all three non-food operations are ei2050:profitable.\nMr. Nadeau ei2051:said ei2052:discussions are under way with potential purchasers of each of the units. He ei2054:declined to ei2055:confirm or ei2056:deny ei2057:reports that Provigo executive Henri Roy is ei2058:trying to ei2059:put together a management ei2060:buy-out of the catalogue showroom unit. Mr. Roy couldn't be ei2061:reached.\nYvon Bussieres was ei2062:named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of Provigo, a new position. Mr. Bussieres was president and chief operating officer of Provigo's Quebec retail and wholesale grocery unit. Mr. Nadeau ei2065:said he ei2066:intends to ei2067:remain Provigo's chief executive only until the non-food businesses are ei2068:sold, after a which a new chief executive will be ei2069:named.",

Total assets ei2419:increased to $12.7 billion in the latest quarter from $12.4 billion a year earlier.\nThe ei2422:loss ei2423:stems from $357.5 million of ei2424:write-downs on Columbia's $4.4 billion high-yield investment securities portfolio, which includes about $3.7 billion of junk bonds, $400 million of preferred stock, and Treasury securities.\nColumbia ei2426:owes its spectacular ei2427:growth in recent years to its junk-bond portfolio, the largest of any U.S. thrift. Much of Columbia's junk-bond ei2428:trading has been ei2429:done through the high-yield department of its Beverly Hills neighbor, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.\nFor the nine months, losses ei2430:totaled $212 million, or $10.83 a share, compared with net income of $48.7 million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier.\nThe results include a $130.2 million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value.\nColumbia also ei2435:added $227.3 million to reserves for ei2436:losses on the portfolio, ei2437:increasing general reserves to $300 million, or about 6.7% of the total portfolio, as of Sept. 30. On June 30, loss reserves ei2439:stood at $108.3 million. Thrift officials ei2440:said the $300 million reserve will be ei2441:adjusted quarterly and will ei2442:reflect the rate of dispositions and market conditions.\nThe adjustments ei2446:result from the recently ei2447:passed thrift-industry bailout legislation, which ei2448:requires thrifts to ei2449:divest all high-yield bond investments by 1994. Previously, Columbia didn't have to ei2451:adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to ei2452:reflect ei2453:declines in market prices, because it ei2454:held the bonds as long-term investments. Because Columbia now must ei2455:sell the bonds within five years, accounting rules ei2456:require the thrift to ei2457:value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices.\nFor its future strategy, Columbia officials ei2458:said the thrift may ei2459:branch out into commercial lending or managing outside investments, as well as ei2462:beefing up more traditional thrift activities.\nThe quarterly results also ei2465:reflected $21.4 million in non-recurring losses from commercial real-estate activities in California.\nThomas Spiegel, Columbia's chairman, ei2468:said in a statement that the thrift was \" ei2470:disappointed\" by the effects of the accounting ei2471:changes. But he ei2472:said Columbia ei2473:remains \"one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry,\" based on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital.\nColumbia ei2475:announced the results after the ei2477:close of the stock market. Its shares ei2478:closed at $5.125 each in composite New York Stock Exchange trading, down 37.5 cents. The price of Columbia shares has been ei2479:cut nearly in half since August, when they ei2480:traded at about $10, as investors apparently ei2481:realized that the thrift would be ei2482:forced to ei2483:take a big write-down. The stock's ei2485:decline ei2486:accelerated in the past two weeks, from a price of $8 a share on Oct. 9.\nColumbia officials ei2488:said they don't ei2489:know how quickly they will ei2490:dispose of the thrift's junk bonds, because federal regulations, such as those that would ei2491:allow thrifts to ei2492:continue ei2493:holding the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries, haven't yet been ei2494:completed.\nColumbia officials also ei2495:said the thrift shouldn't ei2496:face problems meeting regulatory capital requirements, despite the large reserves and write-downs and stiffer regulatory requirements that should be in place by year's end. Its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as of Sept. 30 was 3.6%, and total equity was $457.9 million.\nThe thrift ei2502:emphasized that it ei2503:has a large portfolio of equity securities ei2504:issued in connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged ei2505:buy-outs, which ei2506:has a book value of $90 million.\nAlthough many of the transactions related to those securities haven't been ei2508:completed, Columbia ei2509:said the ultimate gain on the ei2511:sale of those assets will ei2512:range from $200 million to $300 million.

    "text": "Anheuser-Busch Cos. ei2257:said it ei2258:plans to aggressively ei2259:discount its major beer brands, ei2260:setting the stage for a potentially bruising price ei2261:war as the maturing industry's ei2262:growth ei2263:continues to ei2264:slow.\nAnheuser, the world's largest brewer and U.S. market leader, has historically been ei2265:reluctant to ei2266:engage in ei2267:price-cutting as a means of ei2268:boosting sales volume. With the ei2269:passing of the heady days of swelling industry sales, however, the once-sporadic and brief ei2271:forays into ei2272:discounting are ei2273:becoming standard competitive weapons in the beer industry.\nOver the summer, Anheuser competitors ei2274:offered more and deeper ei2275:discounts than industry observers have ei2276:seen for a long time. Some experts now ei2277:predict Anheuser's ei2278:entry into the fray ei2280:means near-term earnings ei2281:trouble for all the industry players.\nThe St. Louis company ei2282:said major rivals, Philip Morris Co.'s Miller Brewing unit and Adolph Coors Co. \"have been ei2283:following a policy of continuous and deep ei2284:discounting for at least the past 18 months\" on their premium brands, ei2285:pricing their product as much as 25 cents a 12-pack below Anheuser's Budweiser label in many markets. Anheuser ei2286:said it's discounting policy basically would ei2287:involve ei2288:matching such ei2289:moves by rivals on a market-by-market basis.\nAnheuser-Busch ei2290:announced its ei2291:plan at the same time it ei2292:reported third-quarter net income ei2293:rose a lower-than-anticipated 5.2% to $238.3 million, or 83 cents a share, from $226.5 million, or 78 cents. Third-period sales were $2.49 billion, up from last year's $2.34 billion.\nAnheuser ei2296:said its new strategy -- ei2297:started in some markets last month and ei2298:expected to be ei2299:applied soon in selected markets nationwide -- will ei2300:mean lower-than-anticipated earnings for the last half of 1989 and for 1990. The ei2301:projection ei2302:sent Anheuser shares ei2303:plunging $4.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. The stock ei2304:closed at $38.50 on heavy volume of about 3.5 million shares. Shares of Coors, the company's sole publicly traded major competitor, ei2305:fell $1.50 apiece to $19.125 in national over-the-counter trading, apparently on investor concerns over potential ei2307:fallout from the coming pricing ei2308:struggle.\nAnheuser ei2309:noted that \"beer industry sales volume is 1989 is ei2311:following the trend that has ei2313:characterized the last half of the '80s, with sales volume being essentially ei2371:flat\" while ei2315:consolidation ei2316:creates fewer, bigger players.\n\"We cannot ei2318:permit a further ei2319:slowing in our volume trend,\" Anheuser ei2320:said, ei2321:adding it will ei2322:take \"appropriate competitive pricing ei2323:actions to ei2324:support our long-term market share growth strategy\" for the premium brands. Anheuser ei2325:said it ei2326:continues to ei2327:hold to its ei2328:earlier-announced goal of a 50% U.S. market share by the mid-1990s.\nBeneath the tepid news-release jargon ei2329:lies a powerful threat from the brewing giant, which last year ei2330:accounted for about 41% of all U.S. beer sales and is ei2331:expected to ei2332:see that ei2333:grow to 42.5% in the current year. \"Anheuser is the biggest guy in the bar, and he just ei2334:decided to ei2335:join in the barroom ei2336:brawl,\" ei2337:said Joseph J. Doyle, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham amp Co. \"It's going to ei2338:get bloody.\"\nJerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketers Insights, a trade newsletter, ei2339:said Anheuser's ei2340:announcement ei2341:means \"everybody else in the industry is going to ei2342:have a difficult time ei2343:reaching their profit objectives.\"\nPrudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst George E. Thompson ei2344:downplayed the importance of the ei2345:announcement, and ei2346:called any comparison between the coming beer-industry tiff and the seemingly unending \"cola wars,\" unwarranted.
