{"text": "Our digital age is all about bits, those precise ones and zeros that are the stuff of modern computer code.\n\nBut a powerful new type of computer that is about to be commercially e1:deployed by a major American military contractor is e2:taking computing into the strange, subatomic realm of quantum mechanics. In that infinitesimal neighborhood, common sense logic no longer seems to apply. A one can be a one, or it can be a one and a zero and everything in between  all at the same time.\n\nIt sounds preposterous, particularly to those familiar with the yes/no world of conventional computing. But academic researchers and scientists at companies like Microsoft, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard have been e6:working to e7:develop quantum computers.\n\nNow, Lockheed Martin  which e8:bought an early version of such a computer from the Canadian company D-Wave Systems two years ago  is e9:confident enough in the technology to e10:upgrade it to commercial scale, e11:becoming the first company to e12:use quantum computing as part of its business.\n\nSkeptics e14:say that D-Wave has yet to e15:prove to outside scientists that it has e16:solved the myriad challenges involved in quantum computation.\n\nBut if it e18:performs as Lockheed and D-Wave e19:expect, the design could be e20:used to e21:supercharge even the most powerful systems, e22:solving some science and business problems millions of times faster than can be e23:done today.\n\nRay Johnson, Lockheeds chief technical officer, e24:said his company would e25:use the quantum computer to e26:create and e27:test complex radar, space and aircraft systems.
