It was a glaring hole, considering that Apple's iPhone e5:has built-in Notes and Reminders apps that can be e6:powered by Siri.\n\nInstead of e7:settling for a bare bones app to e8:fill the void, the search giant e9:took things one step further. Keep isn't simply just a place to bank whatever random half-thoughts come to mind: Users can construct to-do lists, stash photos, and color code your notes -- all in one well-designed and easy-to-use interface.\n\nThe second you log anything into your phone, it is also accessible from a PC Web browser via Google Drive. Alternatively, you can save things while working on your computer, and it will instantly appear on your phone, ready for use while on the go.\n\nThe design may not be as progressive as the to-do app Clear, but Keep makes up for that in its simplicity and efficiency.\n\nEverything in Keep is presented like a Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500) Windows Phone-esque stream of tiles. Swiping left or right will archive those notes you no longer need (but don't want to erase entirely). At the top of the app is a text entry field that serves as your main point of entry for all new notes. And when viewing any specific note, tapping any part of that note (title, body, etc.) will allow you to edit it. The entire experience is frictionless.\n\nThat said, it's not going to e30:conquer the world quite yet. Organization options are limited -- color coding is your only choice, and you can't re-order your notes. Sharing with others is mostly limited to email and Google+, and the desktop features are pretty bare bones.\n\nBut that's more a function of it being new, rather than poorly thought out. Like most things Google, e35:expect the company to e45:flesh out Keep over time and really e36:turn it into our personal internet junk drawer.\n\nIt's easy to e37:foresee the day the when users will be able to e38:send anything from their Web browser or Maps directly to Keep. The prospect of Keep e46:incorporating features of services such as Pinterest or Pocket, or even making it easy to catalog streaming media, could e40:turn it into something big.
