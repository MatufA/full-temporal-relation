A haze akin to volcanic fumes e4:cloaked the capital, e5:causing convulsive e6:coughing and e7:obscuring the portrait of Mao Zedong on the gate to the Forbidden City.\n\nSo severe are China's environmental woes, especially the noxious air, that top government officials have been e8:forced to openly e9:acknowledge them. Fu Ying, the spokeswoman for the National People's Congress, e10:said she e11:checked for smog every morning after opening her curtains and e13:kept at home face masks for her daughter and herself.

{"text": "A Cyprus e2001:exit from the euro union, if it e1:comes to that, would have a devastating e2023:effect on the country's citizens, who are among the most e2006:indebted in the euro zone. And for European unity and diplomacy, the Cyprus e2102:debacle has already been at least a short-term e2007:disaster.\n\nut for the broader financial system in Europe, the losses e2:resulting from a Cypriot banking e2105:collapse and the country's e3:return to its former currency would be minimal compared with the e4:havoc that Greece would have e5:created had it not been e6:bailed out.\n\nAnd that, economists and investors e7:contend, is why Germany and its Dutch stalking horse, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, were so e2008:adamant that depositors - large and small, Cypriot and Russian - e2009:contribute 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) toward the 10 billion euro e2103:bailout of Cyprus's largest banks.\n\nGreece may well have been too big to e8:fail last year, but Cyprus, which e9:creates less than one-half percent of the euro zone's gross domestic product, is certainly not.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, what is most e2012:noteworthy is that the combined debt of the Cypriot people, companies and government is 2.6 times the size of the country's gross domestic product. Only Ireland, still e10:struggling to e11:recover from the banking e2013:collapse that required an international e12:bailout in 2010, has a higher debt-to-G.D.P. e2106:ratio among euro zone countries.\n\nAs debts in Europe e13:mount in inverse proportion to the ability of its citizens, companies and governments to e14:make good on them, the view is e15:forming in Berlin and Brussels that a signal must be e16:sent that citizens and investors must e17:start accepting e2014:losses for the euro zone to e19:survive in the long run.\n\n\"There have been too many bailouts in Europe; it's time to e20:remove the air bags,\" e21:said Stephen Jen, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who runs a hedge fund in London. \"This is not a Lehman,\" he e22:said, e23:referring to the disastrous chain e2100:reaction e24:touched off by the e2016:collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.\n\nEric Dor is a French economist who has e25:studied the mechanics of how a country might e26:remove itself from the monetary union. By his calculations, the euro zone - through its central banking system and its national banks - has just 27 billion euros in outstanding credit e27:exposure to Cyprus. That is a mere rounding error compared with the euro zone G.D.P. of 9.4 trillion euros.\n\nEstimates of the potential cost if Greece had been e30:forced into a disorderly euro e2011:exit have ranged from 200 billion euros to 800 billion euros, given the larger e32:exposure that the European Central Bank and European banks had to the country.\n\n\"This e33:explains why Germany and others are putting so much e34:pressure on Cyprus,\" e35:said Mr. Dor, head of research at the Ieseg School of Management in Lille, France. \"They are e36:saying we can take the risk of e38:pushing Cyprus out of the euro zone, and that Europe can take the e39:losses without going e40:broke.\"\n\nMr. Dor e41:notes that the current euro zonewide system of insuring bank deposits up to 100,000 euros was e42:put in place after the financial e2017:panic that followed the Lehman e43:collapse. Those deposits are e44:supposed to be e45:insured by national governments.\n\nSo when the president of Cyprus e46:admitted this week that his country did not e2104:have the money to backstop the 30 billion euros of guaranteed bank deposits - a figure greater than the Cypriot economy itself - a crucial bond of trust between a government and its citizens was e47:snapped.\n\n\"It is the first time ever that the leader of a euro zone country has e48:admitted that he could not e49:afford to e50:pay the guarantee,\" Mr. Dor e51:said.\n\nA hasty e52:expulsion from the euro zone would make the savings of the Cypriot people all the more e2101:evanescent, once they are e55:converted back into Cypriot pounds, the currency Cyprus used before e57:adopting the euro in 2007.", "doc_id":

{"text": "A Cyprus e2001:exit from the euro union, if it e1:comes to that, would have a devastating e2023:effect on the country's citizens, who are among the most e2006:indebted in the euro zone. And for European unity and diplomacy, the Cyprus e2102:debacle has already been at least a short-term e2007:disaster.\n\nut for the broader financial system in Europe, the losses e2:resulting from a Cypriot banking e2105:collapse and the country's e3:return to its former currency would be minimal compared with the e4:havoc that Greece would have e5:created had it not been e6:bailed out.\n\nAnd that, economists and investors e7:contend, is why Germany and its Dutch stalking horse, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, were so e2008:adamant that depositors - large and small, Cypriot and Russian - e2009:contribute 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) toward the 10 billion euro e2103:bailout of Cyprus's largest banks.\n\nGreece may well have been too big to e8:fail last year, but Cyprus, which e9:creates less than one-half percent of the euro zone's gross domestic product, is certainly not.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, what is most e2012:noteworthy is that the combined debt of the Cypriot people, companies and government is 2.6 times the size of the country's gross domestic product. Only Ireland, still e10:struggling to e11:recover from the banking e2013:collapse that required an international e12:bailout in 2010, has a higher debt-to-G.D.P. e2106:ratio among euro zone countries.\n\nAs debts in Europe e13:mount in inverse proportion to the ability of its citizens, companies and governments to e14:make good on them, the view is e15:forming in Berlin and Brussels that a signal must be e16:sent that citizens and investors must e17:start accepting e2014:losses for the euro zone to e19:survive in the long run.\n\n\"There have been too many bailouts in Europe; it's time to e20:remove the air bags,\" e21:said Stephen Jen, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who runs a hedge fund in London. \"This is not a Lehman,\" he e22:said, e23:referring to the disastrous chain e2100:reaction e24:touched off by the e2016:collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.\n\nEric Dor is a French economist who has e25:studied the mechanics of how a country might e26:remove itself from the monetary union. By his calculations, the euro zone - through its central banking system and its national banks - has just 27 billion euros in outstanding credit e27:exposure to Cyprus. That is a mere rounding error compared with the euro zone G.D.P. of 9.4 trillion euros.\n\nEstimates of the potential cost if Greece had been e30:forced into a disorderly euro e2011:exit have ranged from 200 billion euros to 800 billion euros, given the larger e32:exposure that the European Central Bank and European banks had to the country.\n\n\"This e33:explains why Germany and others are putting so much e34:pressure on Cyprus,\" e35:said Mr. Dor, head of research at the Ieseg School of Management in Lille, France. \"They are e36:saying we can take the risk of e38:pushing Cyprus out of the euro zone, and that Europe can take the e39:losses without going e40:broke.\"\n\nMr. Dor e41:notes that the current euro zonewide system of insuring bank deposits up to 100,000 euros was e42:put in place after the financial e2017:panic that followed the Lehman e43:collapse. Those deposits are e44:supposed to be e45:insured by national governments.\n\nSo when the president of Cyprus e46:admitted this week that his country did not e2104:have the money to backstop the 30 billion euros of guaranteed bank deposits - a figure greater than the Cypriot economy itself - a crucial bond of trust between a government and its citizens was e47:snapped.\n\n\"It is the first time ever that the leader of a euro zone country has e48:admitted that he could not e49:afford to e50:pay the guarantee,\" Mr. Dor e51:said.\n\nA hasty e52:expulsion from the euro zone would make the savings of the Cypriot people all the more e2101:evanescent, once they are e55:converted back into Cypriot pounds, the currency Cyprus used before e57:adopting the euro in 2007.", "doc_id":
